El-Rufai while speaking commended Tinubu for cancelling his 70th-anniversary colloquium in honour of the victims of the attack. The Kaduna State Governor noted that he is his awareness of the presidential ambition of Tinubu, but said God will choose the best leader for Nigeria. He said, “This gesture by Asiwaju is a show of powerful leadership, empathy and concern for the lives and property of Nigerians. It’s unprecedented in our history in Nigeria. The government and people of Kaduna state will never forget this gesture. We are very grateful to you for your service, sacrifice and commitment to the unity and that of our country. We appreciate your call for people to contribute to enabling us to rehabilitate the victims of this tragedy. “We are aware of your aspiration to be president of this country, we look forward to furthering engagement so that we can progress that aspiration. “Nigeria is at crossroads, a critical crossroads, and we must take very difficult decisions to get the right leaders that would take us out of the multiple quagmires that we are going through. These are human challenges and they can be solved by human ingenuity. I pray for God to choose who is best for Nigeria so that we will be the better, united, progressive and exemplary country that is fair and just to everyone.” This article was originally published on Nigeria News Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
