  “She did not d#e of cancer. The husband, Mr Peter Nwachukwu h#t her with his leg on the chest. All these while, he had been be@ting her but my sister hid all that she was passing through from us. Before now, we told her to come out of the marriage, we told her that they are not divorcing, that it’s just separation. But she felt that God is against divorce.   It was the h#tting on the chest that k#lled her.   My brother had to ask doctor what k#lled her and doctor said that there were clusters of bl#od on her chest. Unfortunately, they did not tell the doctor that she was k#cked on the chest because; doctor could have known what to do if he had idea of what happened.  Each time we talked to her, she will be pleading for peace and if we move to act, she will tell us no, that we should calm down,” she said.
