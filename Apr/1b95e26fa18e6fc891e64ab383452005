  The 18-year-old friend, identified as David, introduced Albert to a Muslim cleric, Alfa Araokanmi, for a money-making ritu@l that eventually ter#inated his life.

It was gathered that after the introduction, Alfa Araokanmi promised to do some propitiation that would make Albert become a successful internet fraudster.

“They actually started chatting on Whatsapp until the boy later visited Alfa Araokanmi for some money ritu@ls leading to his untimely de@th,” a source said.

The source said that Araokanmi told the deceased that he would ingest concoctions and bath at midnight for some days after which he should expect a ghost that would give him a sum of N5 million every day.

The money ritual, however, went awry when he returned home about three weeks ago panting and feeling weak. Before his de@th moments later, Albert reportedly explained all that transpired between him and Araokanmi to his father and even urged him to check his mobile phone for the exchanges between him and the cleric on Whatsapp.  Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
