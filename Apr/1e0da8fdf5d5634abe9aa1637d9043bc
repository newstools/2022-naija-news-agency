Falana said this on Friday at the burial of the Kwara state chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Akinwumi Akinsola, who was killed during a recent attack on a Kaduna-bound train. The popular lawyer asserted that Nigeria has some of the most patriotic soldiers in the world, stressing that appropriate weapons to fight the terrorists are missing. Falana, therefore, asked the Federal Government to provide adequate weapons for the soldiers, noting that it is suicidal for the soldiers to face terrorists. He said: “l can say without any fear of contradiction that Nigeria has some of the most patriotic soldiers in the world. “All that is missing is appropriate weapons to fight the terrorists who are well-equipped. “I am speaking from my personal knowledge because I defend top-ranking soldiers — generals who are charged illegally for demanding weapons to fight terrorists. “Troops are prepared to fight, but they are simply saying it is suicidal to face terrorists with inadequate weapons.” Falana, however, asked Nigerians to dismiss the proposal of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State that foreign mercenaries should be hired to fight insurgents.
