 Some 25.48 percent of voters had showed up at the ballot box by noon, compared with 28.54 percent in the last presidential election in 2017, when Emanuel Macron was first elected president. However, participation so far remains above the record trough of 21.40 percent in 2002. Updated turnout numbers are expected at 5 p.m. local time. The polls close at 8 p.m., which is when the first exit polls will be published. President Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen are the clear front-runners among the 12 candidates, although Macron’s lead has significantly narrowed in recent days. The president’s camp is worried that high abstention rates could be used by opposition candidates in case of a Macron victory to question the legitimacy of his win.  The two winners from today’s round will face each other off in a second round on April 24. Close to 49 million people are eligible to vote in the presidential contest.
