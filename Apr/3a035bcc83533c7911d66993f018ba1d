Piers Morgan has uncharacteristically applauded Boris Johnson after his trip to Ukraine amid the war against Russia. The Prime Minister secretly travelled to Kyiv, the country’s capital, last week to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Photos emerged of the two leaders shaking hands and having civil talks as Mr Johnson pledged to offer more military support and aid from the UK. Praising the Conservative leader, Piers tweeted: ‘This was a bold, gutsy thing to do, Prime Minister. Made me feel proud to be British which is not something you’ve made me feel very often since you took office. Bravo.’ It was a surprise to Piers’ followers as the broadcaster has been notoriously critical of the Prime Minister over the past two years, due to the Government’s handling of the Covid pandemic and, most recently, the Partygate scandal at Downing Street. His complimentary tweet was a response to Mr Johnson’s Twitter post, which said: ‘Today I met my friend President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv as a show of our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine. This was a bold, gutsy thing to do, Prime Minister. Made me feel proud to be British which is not something youâve made me feel very often since you took office. Bravo. ðð https://t.co/s5sA9axT5T — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) April 10, 2022 ‘We’re setting out a new package of financial & military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.’ Piers, 57, later reacted to Mr Zelensky’s recent interview with 60 Minutes in which he was asked if other nations have a moral responsibility to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, to which he said yes. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T1M11S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/10/11/56435711-0-image-a-43_1649587679847.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-04-10T11:47:30+0100","description":"Volodymyr Zelensky said the leadership shown by the UK would 'go down in history' after meeting Boris Johnson in Kyiv.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/04/10/5254770755826369293/480x270_MP4_5254770755826369293.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web
