Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was given a warm welcome to the US Supreme Court by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday at a celebration held in her honor on the South Lawn of the White House. ‘Today is indeed a wonderful day as we gather to celebrate the confirmation of the next justice of the United States supreme court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson,’ said Harris at the top of the event. Harris recalled the nation’s first President George Washington, who famously once ‘referred to America as a great experiment, a nation founded on the previously untested belief that the people, we the people, could form a more perfect union.’ ‘That belief has pushed our nation forward. For generations. And it is that belief that we learned yesterday,’ Harris added. To a roaring crowd Harris noted the historical significance of Jackson’s confirmation to the high court, before welcoming the President to the podium. ‘This is going to let so much sunshine on so many young women, so many young black men, so many minorities, it’s real,’ Biden said. ‘We’re going to look back and see this is a moment of real change in American history.’ Jackson will become the first black woman to sit on the nation’s highest judicial panel. She was confirmed by the Senate in a 53-47 vote on Thursday with all members of the Democratic party and three Republicans voting for her nomination. She will assume her duties on the court in the summer, when Justice Stephen Breyer, who she is replacing, will retire.
