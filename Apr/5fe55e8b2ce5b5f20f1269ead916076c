This is coming less than a week after Adamu disclosed his plans to look into the finances of the party under his predecessor. Recall that the APC leadership had appealed a judgment of the Federal High Court recognising the Akwa Ibom State faction of the APC led by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, over that of the erstwhile Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe. But in a letter signed by the Head, Legal Services of the APC, which was addressed to Adeniyi Akintola (SAN) & Company dated April 6, 2022, Adamu had directed that all cases appealed by Buni’s committee be immediately withdrawn. The letter titled, ‘Notice of Withdrawal of Instruction’, read in part, “I have the instruction of the national legal adviser to convey the decision of the leadership of the party to obey the judgment in respect of the above captioned suit having been served with the same. “Our instruction on the above matter was terminated at the Federal High Court. Consequently, the party is not interested in pursuing the appeal in respect of the above matter. “I have further instructions of the national legal adviser to request that you withdraw all the processes filed on behalf of the party and H.E. Mai Mala Buni, the erstwhile national chairman of the CECPC, at the Court of Appeal.” It was gathered APC had begun the process of withdrawing all the cases from the Court of Appeal. Speaking to The PUNCH, top APC sources warned Senator Abdullahi Adamu against reversing moves by Buni, warming it may lead to massive defection and crisis. “The best thing for Senator Adamu to have done was to allow the cases to run their course. There are over 200 cases in court at the moment. He should have let them continue,” an APC chieftain said. “What the new national chairman is doing now is to reverse Buni’s actions and those who feel slighted will be forced to leave the party.” This article was originally published on Nigeria News Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
