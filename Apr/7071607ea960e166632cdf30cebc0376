                            video Khloé Kardashian has dubbed her ex Tristan Thompson a ‘great guy’, recalling how he cheated on her shortly before she gave birth, but he still joined her in the delivery room. The reality star was speaking as part of an ABC News special with Good Morning America, where her mother, Kris Jenner, gushed over Kim Kardashian’s new boyfriend, Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson. Khloé, 37, and professional basketball player Tristan, 31, first met in August 2016, with the pair announcing in December the following year that they were expecting a baby. However, in April 2018, soon before they welcomed their daughter True, reports emerged of the athlete ‘kissing multiple women’. Despite the cheating scandal, the on-off couple reconciled, before their relationship was rocked once again in January this year when it was confirmed that Tristan had fathered a son with another woman. In the new interview with GMA anchor Robin Roberts, the members of the Kardashian clan opened up about their lives, with Khloé speaking candidly about how she feels about Tristan after everything they’ve been through together. The Good American co-founder recollected how ‘incredibly safe’ she felt with him at the start of their relationship, stating: ‘I felt really good for a time’. ‘I remember when he cheated on me right before I gave birth, and I was able to still have him in the delivery room,’ she said. ‘And so yes, it might have looked strange to the outside world, but when my daughter watches my home videos of it, those videos are going to be as pure and perfect as I was able to make them. I still think he’s a great guy and he’s a great dad, he’s just not the guy for me.’ Khloé added that in her opinion, she’s the only member of her family not in the ‘best place to be in a relationship’. Elsewhere in the ABC News special, Kim said that she’s ‘very happy and very content’ in her relationship with Pete, telling Robin: ‘I am a relationship kind of girl, for sure. I wouldn’t be with someone if I didn’t plan on spending a lot of my time with them.’ Momager Kris described Pete as ‘great’ and ‘a really nice guy’, while Khloé said: ‘He just makes her laugh and she laughs all the time.’ Kim filed for divorce from rapper Kanye West in February 2021 after six years of marriage. The pair share four children together: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.
