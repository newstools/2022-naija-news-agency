Footage released after the jailing of Sabina Nessa’s ‘evil’ murderer reveals how he skulked around a hotel and supermarket in the hours before he attacked her. Koci Selamaj, 36, killed the 28-year-old primary school teacher as she walked through a park in Kidbrooke Village, south-east London, on the evening of September 17 last year. CCTV showed him bludgeoning her 34 times with a metal traffic triangle before carrying her unconscious body out of view, removing her tights and underwear and strangling her before covering her body in grass. Coming just months after the murder of Sarah Everard, her death added to ‘the sense of insecurity’ felt by women walking in cities at night, a judge told the Old Bailey. Evidence shown in court painted a picture of Selamaj, who had no previous convictions, planning a vile act after the breakdown of his marriage. After the murder, his estranged wife told officers he had become violent towards her in recent months, including throttling her a number of times, prompting her to flee their home in fear of her life. Selamaj had booked a £325-a-night room for the night of Sabina’s death at The Grand Hotel in Eastbourne, Sussex, where his wife worked at a cleaner, despite living ten minutes around the corner from it. The booking, which he made just three days earlier, showed he planned to have a sexual encounter of some kind that night, jurors were told. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T2M17S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/08/11/56372689-0-image-a-48_1649414595967.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-04-08T11:42:12+0100","description":"Koci Selamaj has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years at the Old Bailey, central London, for the murder of primary school teacher Sabina Nessa who was killed as she walked through Cator Park on her way to meet a friend in Kidbrooke, south-east London on September 17, 2021.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/04/08/3174337118218795703/480x270_MP4_3174337118218795703.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

                            video On the day of the killing, he asked his wife to meet him in his car, where he appeared ‘very agitated’. He tried to persuade her to have sex but reportedly did not tell her about his booking at the hotel. She turned him down and went back into the hotel, and remained oblivious to his presence while he returned to his room, where he stayed for a while before driving around Eastbourne, Brighton and, eventually, Kidbrooke. The newly-released CCTV shows him entering the hotel and leaving just before 5pm. Selamaj, of Albanian origin, was also caught wandering the aisles of a Sainsbury’s, where he stopped along the drive and bought a rolling pin, chilli flakes and an energy drink. The rolling pin is believed to have been his intended murder weapon, but left it in his boot when he realised a red vehicle warning triangle would be easier to conceal under his jacket. His car was captured driving down a country lane in Tunbridge Wells, and the excessive length of the journey led detectives to the discovery of the triangle at a section of the River Teise where he had stopped to dump it. The footage showed him returning to the hotel at midnight, where he spent the night. When he was charged with murder nine days later, he told police: ‘What will happen if I open up now and say everything?’ Lewis Power QC, defending, said his client had provided no explanation for the killing, adding: ‘He simply accepts that he did it’.
