Kristen Stewart was lavished with love on her birthday by fiancée Dylan Meyer. Marking her partner’s 32nd birthday on Saturday, screenwriter Dylan shared a photo of herself leaning in for a kiss with Kristen as a birthday cake was presented. ‘Another one around the sun and you’re out here getting flyer every year,’ Dylan gushed in the caption. She added: ‘Time looks good on you, dude. Ya know, as they say in the toons, “awooga.”’ In the sweet image, Oscar-nominee Kristen, who Avril Lavigne is gunning for to play her in a biopic, kept things casual in a blue T-shirt and black baseball cap with her blonde hair casually messy, while Dylan, 34, was all in black. Friends and followers dropped by to offer their birthday wishes, with Thor: Love and Thunder director Taika Waititi liking Dylan’s tribute while Paris Hilton left two heart face emojis. https://www.instagram.com/p/CcI3pcEJ-LH/ ‘Love her so much, we’re so proud of her,’ wrote one fan of the Twilight star, while another posted: ‘Happy birthday to our queen kristen!!! 💕💕’ The couple got engaged in November 2021 after two years in a relationship, following Moxie writer Dylan’s proposal. They walked the red carpet together at the 2022 Academy Awards, where Kristen was nominated in the best actress category for her turn as Princess Diana in Spencer. The pair shared a kiss as they posed for photos together, holding hands and wearing matching black and white suit outfits. Kristen was up against Jessica Chastain for The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Olivia Colman for The Lost Daughter, Penelope Cruz for Parallel Mothers, and Nicole Kidman for Being The Ricardos, with Jessica ultimately taking home the accolade. She, alongside West Side Story star Ariana DeBose, were the first openly LGBTQ+ stars nominated in the Oscar’s acting categories in 20 years. Although Dylan and Kristen are yet to make any formal announcement over their wedding plans, Kristen confessed in an interview that she ‘isn’t a good planner’ and also is not bothered by having an extravagant ceremony.
