Chris Pine has sung Harry Styles praises in his acting career, specifically his work ethic while honing his craft. The Star Trek actor, 41, who stars alongside Harry in the upcoming film Don’t Worry Darling, had nothing but good things to say about Harry, 28. Appearing on The One Show via video link from Los Angeles, Chris gushed: ‘Harry, honestly, he’s a lovely man. ‘To be that young and to be that famous and have your head screwed on right, he’s a humble hard-worker. ‘He shows up to set earlier than everybody else, hungry to learn, and he and Florence [Pugh], I saw the film actually, just knock it out of the park.’ Harry and Florence star as the lead roles Jack and Alice in Don’t Worry Darling, the psychological thriller directed by Harry’s real-life girlfriend Olivia Wilde, 38, who he met on the set. Chris, meanwhile, plays the supporting role of Frank in the upcoming movie. Harry’s first big-screen role was in 2017’s Dunkirk and he will also star in My Policeman. While he has been adding to his acting credits thick and fast, one film Harry won’t be taking part in is Nosferatu. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T11S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/13/18/47866797-0-image-a-19_1631554368685.jpg","uploadDate":"2021-09-13T18:29:10+0100","description":"A 1950's housewife living with her husband in a utopian experimental community begins to worry that his glamorous company may be hiding disturbing secrets.nnStarring Florence Pugh, Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine and Harry Styles.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2021/09/13/8773874502736167346/640x360_MP4_8773874502736167346.mp4","height":360,"width":640}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web
