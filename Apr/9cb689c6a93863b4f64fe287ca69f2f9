Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. Global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion. Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps to try, too.

The change to Apple’s App Store Review guidelines only applies to what Apple calls “reader” apps — meaning, apps designed primarily to provide access to some sort of digital content, like magazines, books, audio, music or video. Apple’s plans were first announced last September in the context of the tech giant’s settlement with a Japanese regulator, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and had been set to arrive sometime in early 2022. The company had earlier said the changes would apply globally to all reader apps on the App Store when they went live, but had not provided an exact launch date. Specifically, Apple instructs developers to apply for something it calls the External Link Account Entitlement in order to provide this functionality in their own apps. Developers must apply for the entitlement and then be approved in order to make the change. Apple has been leveraging the use of entitlements whenever it’s been pushed by lawmakers or regulators to update its App Store rules in an area. By doing so, it’s still in compliance with the letter of the law, but it places an additional burden on those developers who want to take advantage of the new options — like dating apps in the Netherlands, which are now permitted by law to use third-party billing, for example. Apple could easily update its App Store rules to document that this sort of new functionality is now permitted in select use cases, but it still wants to exert control over the whole process and ensure developers who don’t meet the requirements slip through the cracks. It’s disappointing to see Apple continuing to fight so hard against this larger turning of the tide for its app marketplace — even getting itself entangled in expensive lawsuits like the one with Epic Games — instead of having earlier simplified commissions across the board with a sizable — but still manageable — price cut. One has to wonder if Apple could have headed off developers’ and regulators’ concerns by taking a different path from the complicated carve-outs it has proceeded to embrace. The multitrillion-dollar company can afford to make less money from users’ App Store purchases. And it could find a variety of ways to monetize its app developer ecosystem differently in the future. It seems Apple is already looking into bringing payment processing technology in-house in a bid to generate more revenue and reduce reliance on fintech partners. While this effort would impact all parts of Apple’s larger business, it could also help Apple handle the App Store losses that arose from lowered commissions.   Image Credits: Roblox March 31, 2022 was the deadline for the submission of amicus briefs supporting Apple in the Epic appeal. Among the new signers were those from former national security officials, including Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former DNI and NSA director, and two former CIA directors, Gen. Hayden and John Brennan. The officials agree with Apple’s positioning that its commission structure is fair and allows it to create a “safe and secure ecosystem.” What’s interesting, however, is that Roblox also filed a brief to support Apple’s cause. A platform maker itself, albeit one that hosts online games not mobile apps, it’s likely aware of the impact of app market regulations on its own business. In particular, Roblox pointed to the need for platforms to set the standards for, review and approve software, user-generated content and apps that appear on platforms. It stressed how Apple’s App Review system benefits all apps in the Apple ecosystem, including its own mobile Roblox app, by providing a level of safety and security. While the company didn’t say Apple should be protected from all antitrust scrutiny, it made a solid argument against removing the platform model entirely. Wrote Roblox: None of this is to say that Apple necessarily has it right whereas other platform models have it wrong, or that all decisions Apple might make regarding its App Store platform and related policies are sacrosanct or should be de facto protected from antitrust scrutiny. But the key point is that Apple’s model does provide real benefits to security and privacy. No platform is going to be perfect in its efforts to rid an ecosystem of bad actors, but it is core to Roblox’s beliefs that real, tangible results can be obtained where there is an enhanced focus on safety and security. The evidence at trial did not show that all of these benefits necessarily can be retained while eliminating the platform model that has allowed for them. Roblox’s experience, consistent with the evidence presented here, is that these particular procompetitive aspects of the App Store are real and intertwined with the way Apple structures its platform. The district court was right not to cast them aside as mere “pretext,” and neither should this Court.

But the ban has only resulted in sending another app just like Instagram to No. 1 on the Russian App Store. On March 29 and 30, a Russian app called Fiesta became the top free iPhone app in the country after having first launched on November 25, 2021. The first time it ever charted in the top free apps in the country was on March 26. There’s not a lot of information about Fiesta, though it appears to be Russian-made. Its website doesn’t offer much information beyond what the app looks like and a form to join the beta. The site also displays photos of the app and links out to Fiesta’s social accounts, including Instagram and Twitter — the latter where it’s never posted. The app greatly resembles Instagram, but it also offers features for finding and joining local events, which differentiates it. According to Sensor Tower’s preliminary estimates, Fiesta has now seen nearly 200,000 installs to date — most of which occurred this past week. From March 27 to March 30, the app saw around 184,000 installs — or more than 30 times the 6,000 installs it saw in the prior period from March 23 to March 26.
