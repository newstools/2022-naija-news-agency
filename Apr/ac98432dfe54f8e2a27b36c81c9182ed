 Recall that on Friday night, April 8, 2022 the national grid coll@psed for the third time in less than one month. Speaking in a statement, on Saturday, April 9, the media spokesperson of the ministry of power, Isa Sanusi, said that the recent coll@pse was caused by the vand@lisation of a transmission power in the south-south region. According to the statement, “We wish to apprise the general public that the immediate cause of national blackout (system coll@pse) was an act of vand@lism on a transmission tower on the Odukpani-Ikot Ekpene 330kV double circuit transmission line thus resulting in a sudden loss of about 400 MW of generation. This consequently led to a cascade of plants shutdown across the country. We wish to notify the public that power on the grid is being restored sequentially by the system lperator as other on-grid power plants are being dispatched to cover the lost generation capacity from the Calabar power plant owned by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company Ltd.” <img fifu-featured="1" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-200636" src="https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=1080,1080&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blackout: Why national grid coll@psed for the third time in less than a month — FG" title="Blackout: Why national grid coll@psed for the third time in less than a month — FG" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=700%2C700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=672%2C672&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=1038%2C1038&amp;ssl=1 1038w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278179844_142754418259054_6934758006864829326_n.jpg?resize=270%2C270&amp;ssl=1 270w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-200637" src="https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=1080,1080&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=700%2C700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=672%2C672&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=1038%2C1038&amp;ssl=1 1038w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/278079436_3251192271784121_6357933342607740954_n.jpg?resize=270%2C270&amp;ssl=1 270w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
