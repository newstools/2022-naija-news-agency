Viewers were baffled by an overpriced cheese toastie on the first episode of Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars. The Apprentice-style competition sees 12 food and drink entrepreneurs battle it out over challenges to win Chef Ramsay’s £150,000 investment. In the first episode which aired on Thursday, the contestants took part in a street food challenge, where they worked to attract customers to their menus and stalls and make the most profit from sales of their dishes. One team, naming their stall The Toast of the Town, went for the traditional comfort food of toasties. Yet viewers were shocked at the pricing of the household dish, with many commenting that £8 was far too overpriced. As Gordon advised the contestants after they revealed the price: ‘We’re going to have an outcry, and we’ll all be banned from Cornwall if we charge £8 for that.’ {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T37S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/02/16/56132183-0-image-a-136_1648911984684.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-04-02T16:04:35+0100","description":"During a street food challenge Gordon Ramsay's Future Food Stars viewers were left shocked after a contestant charged u00a38 for a cheese toastie.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/04/02/734487412907752439/480x270_MP4_734487412907752439.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

                            video Taking to Twitter to share their bewilderment, one fan wrote: ‘What kind of dipstick pays £8 then waits an hour for a cheese toastie? In Cornwall, surrounded by pasties #FFS.’ Another, who used the same hashtag ideal for the sweary chef and his new show, wrote:  ‘£8 & a 40 minute wait for a Freaking cheese toastie! Good luck with that that then #FutureFoodStars #FFS.’ Even Gordon himself admitted during the episode that the wait for a simple cheese toastie was so long, he could have gone to the supermarket to get the ingredients and make it himself.

The team who had chosen tacos were sadly in the last spot, even though they would have been safe if they had just sold ten more tacos. After individually grilling the four team members, Smoked Salmon entrepreneur Vincenzo Gentile became the first contestant to be eliminated. Speaking about his first firing, Gordon said: ‘I had to let Vincenzo go because in business you have to put your strongest people in their strongest positions and he did the opposite. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T41S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/31/12/56049169-0-image-a-1_1648725967080.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-03-31T12:24:17+0100","description":"Gordon Ramsay is on the hunt for the UK's most exciting and innovative new food and drink business to invest in.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/03/31/4480361955455120867/480x270_MP4_4480361955455120867.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web
