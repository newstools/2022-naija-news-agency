 Frank Lampard has lost eight of his 12 games in charge of Everton 😳 pic.twitter.com/StwqKkh8xO — ESPN UK (@ESPNUK) April 6, 2022  Ivorian star Maxwel Cornet gave Sean Dyche’s men the lead 5-minutes before full-time, completing a vital second-half back for the home side. Everton had gone into the changing rooms with a 2-1 lead after going 1-0 down on 12-minutes via Nathan Collins before Brazilian international Richarlison bagged a brace from the penalty spot, which gave the Toffees a deserved lead going into the interval. But that lead would not hold, however, and the end result now sees Lampard’s men on 25-points and just one clear of Burnley who have climbed to 24-points, while also sitting only 3-points ahead of Watford who sit nineteenth in the table. There is a real chance that Everton, one of the most storied clubs in English football history, ends up failing to avoid the drop zone and coming to rest in the Championship. With upcoming fixtures against Manchester United, Leicester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Leicester City again, it is hard to see that there is a way out for the Toffees barring a miracle. But how have fans of the club taken the loss tonight? See for yourself. “individual mistakes”
“they” Sounds like he’s absolving himself.
