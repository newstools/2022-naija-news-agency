Damilola Olakanmi, a 23-year-old U.K-based Nigerian law student, has d#ed after eating a suspected cann@bis sweet.

The Hertfordshire University student bought the sweet through a messaging app and they were delivered to her home in London, where she fell ill on Tuesday, March 29, 2022.

DailyMail reports that she was rushed to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, at around 11.30pm and sadly, d#ed on Saturday night, April 2, leaving behind her 51-year-old mother, identified simply as Wumi.

.
Her 21-year-old friend – a US student visiting the UK – was also seen by medics but was discharged after treatment.
.
.
Her mom’s friend, Richard Taylor, told the Standard: “Wumi has lost her only child – she has nothing now. They had to hold her up because she broke down every time a friend came to the house to give support.
.
.
It’s a tr@gic warning to all young people about how they live their lives. They should resist dr#gs. Damilola was a promising young woman who should be looking forward to her future and having children of her own.”

He was subsequently charged with possession with intent to supply Class B synthetic cannabinoid, being concerned in the supply of a synthetic cannabinoid, and possession with intent to supply a psychoactive substance. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4f8.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="📸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1">: BPM Media Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
