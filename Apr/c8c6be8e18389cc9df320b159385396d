  Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Citadel Global Community Church may soon declare his intention to run for the 2023 presidency. Bakare said he had the vision for a new Nigeria and he was the best suitable candidate to address the problems confronting Nigeria.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Tunde Bakare Preachin.jpg?itok=oCnRV-uB" alt="">   The pastor and former vice presidential candidate disclosed this on Saturday at the virtual meeting unveiling Project 16 to Nigerians in Diaspora. Bakare urged Nigerians to consider the capacity of candidates before electing a leader in 2023. The cleric warned that ahead of the 2023 general elections, the South was being set against the North, while Christians were set against Muslims. He, however, said he remains the rallying point to restore order in the country. He said, “The PTB brand is a rallying point for all Nigerians. I have a vision of a new Nigeria and I will play a leading role as we approach the Nigeria of our dreams.” Politics News  AddThis :  Original Author : Saharareporters, New York  Disable advertisements : Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
