 An altogether bizarre incident during the Bundesliga meeting between Bayern Munich and SC Freiburg on Saturday could, according to reports, see the former hit with a points deduction. The moment in question came late in Bayern’s eventual 4-1 triumph at the Europa-Park Stadion, and saw, for a short stretch, 12 members of the Bavarian giants’ squad take their place on the pitch. After Julian Nagelsmann attempted to make a double substitution with 85 minutes on the clock, introducing Niklas Sule and Marcel Sabitzer to the fray, only one player, in the form of Corentin Tolisso, made way. In turn, close to 20 seconds of action went on to pass with the evening’s visitors proceeding with 12 men. The action was only brought to a halt upon Freiburg’s players notifying the referee of the issue, with Christian Dingert, the man overseeing the exchanges in Germany’s southwest, quickly making his way to the sideline to gain an understanding of what exactly had gone wrong.

This came owing to an alleged mistake on the part of Bayern team manager Kathleen Kruger. So, what next? In reality, the momentary mix-up at the Europa-Park Stadion had no bearing on the outcome of the clash, with the evening’s visitors having gained no advantage courtesy of their extra man. After taking note of the incident in his official match report, referee Dingert explained post-match that: “Now the DFB (the German Football Association) must decide.” And, if ensuing reports in the media are anything to go by, then the bizarre developments late in Saturday’s clash could yet see Bayern forced to face up to serious consequences. This comes amid suggestions that the Bundesliga table-toppers may well be stripped of their three-point haul, with the game’s spoils instead awarded to Freiburg. Marca, for one, citing German outlet Sport Bild, have reported that ‘the win could be taken away from Bayern, with a possible points deduction too.’ Bayern played with 12 players after a mixup by subs on and off.
It was only for 20 seconds. It had no impact at the game (4-1 win away at Freiburg). But I do think the Bundesliga will take the points away from Bayern. Seems the rule are quite clear — Jan Aage Fjørtoft 🏳️‍🌈 🇳🇴 💛💙 (@JanAageFjortoft) April 2, 2022  Others, however, have assured that such a sanction appears altogether unlikely, with the game’s laws pointing towards a booking for the 12th man involved, and blame being attributed to the team of officials, rather than Bayern themselves: There has been a claim on the Bundesliga broadcast that #Bayern could be stripped off their points because of the extra man on the pitch. That’s very unlikely, law is clear here, it’s a yellow card for the extra player, also the mistake is due to referee and not the team. — Manuel Veth (@ManuelVeth) April 2, 2022    Thomas Mueller scored a bizarre own goal as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich were held to a 1-1 draw by Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, while Angelino salvaged RB Leipzig a crucial point against top-four rivals Freiburg.
