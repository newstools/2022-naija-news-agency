Jennifer Lopez has confirmed she and Ben Affleck are engaged again, sharing the happy news in an announcement to fans. The singer, 52, sent out a video message to fans in her newsletter on Friday, which revealed her stunning green ring as a teary-eyed Jennifer put a hand up to her face, before she can be heard saying: ‘You’re perfect’. Fans had already suspected that Ben, 49, might have popped the question as Jennifer had been seen with a large ring on her wedding finger last week while furniture shopping with her daughter Emme, 14. The singer did not address it at the time and TMZ claims she spun the stone around to face her palm when she spotted photographers in the vicinity. News of Bennifer’s engagement comes a year after they rekindled their relationship after 17 years apart. The pair previously began dating in July 2002 and got engaged in November of the same year, however they postponed their wedding which had been scheduled for September 2003 and ultimately split in January 2004.
