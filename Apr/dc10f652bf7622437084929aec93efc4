Emmerdale fans are going to be on the edge of their seats in upcoming episodes, as Meena Jutla (Paige Sandhu) stands trial for her multiple crimes. Meena has already pleaded guilty to killing Ben, so she knows that she’s facing prison anyway. So from her perspective, the trial is about having her moment in the spotlight and also using the opportunity to get revenge on others. Paige Sandhu explained Meena’s thinking to Metro.co.uk: ‘Her plan was to take as many people down with her – Liam (Jonny McPherson) for pushing Meena from the bridge. If he gets sent to prison for the rest of his life, she won’t have to see him but she’ll know that she got her revenge. She wants Manpreet (Rebecca Sarker) to be in prison with her because then they could be like sisters together in prison, get in trouble together and Manpreet will forgive her and it’ll all be fine, in her delusional little world.’  She’s back at last!

As Meena lies and manipulates her way through the trial, what at first seemed like a foregone conclusion suddenly looks more in the balance and there’s a very real possibility that the jury will decide in Meena’s favour. As Liam, Charles (Kevin Mathurin), Manpreet and others wait for the verdict there’s huge concern – will they ever see justice for Leanna, Andrea and Meena’s other victims?
