He was later arraigned on May 11, 2020, for allegedly defr@uding some Foreign Nationals of $8,502,000 US Dollars in a suit marked FHC/PH/40C/2020. The Judge made it clear that he see no reason to warrant the court to order the defendant to enter a defence. I so hold. “Consequent upon my findings, I find the defendant not guilty, and he is hereby discharged,” Justice Mohammed declared. PW2’s evidence under cross-examination further revealed that no proof of any payment whatsoever from any of the alleged victims to the defendant. Similarly, the evidence of PW2 under cross-examination revealed no response was received from the Egyptian Embassy. Justice Mohammed further declared: “In my view, the evidence of PW1 & PW2 has been so b@dly discredited from the nature of their cross-examination by learned defence Counsel to the extent that the evidence can’t be relied upon.” Narrating his experiences, he cond#mned the way EFCC operatives in a Gestapo style, r@ided his house in Umuahia, scaling through the fence by 4:30am in the morning is a disrespect to all citizen of Nigeria atlarge because it may happen to another tomorrow. ”I asked them: What did I do? Was any petition written against me but they said they were working on intelligence. They said I had committed an offence and should go for plea-bargain but I told them ‘over my d#ad body should I go for any plea-bargain’ because I know I committed no cr!me. Their aim was to hum!liate me and discredit my reputation. I will allow God to judge every one involve in this Bl@ckmailing accordingly.  GOD BLESS.” @Officialnwantaanayoeze <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3a5.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="🎥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1">: @Vanguardngr.com Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
