 European football’s showpiece event will be held at the Stade de France, for the first time since 2006, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine left St. Petersburg as an untenable host city for the game. Multiple officials said that French President Emmanuel Macron was heavily involved Thursday afternoon in talks with UEFA chief Aleksander Čeferin about moving the final to France — an idea that Čeferin conceived and supported. Čeferin traveled to Paris on Thursday to meet Macron and finalize the deal. For Macron, officials said, swiping the final from Russia was seen as a coup — following a controversial call in the early hours of Monday in which the French president thought he’d secured continuing diplomatic talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Hours later, Putin took the step of recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk so-called People’s Republics in eastern Ukraine. In a statement released after a meeting Friday morning of UEFA’s Executive Committee, European football’s governing body said: “UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis.” Russian and Ukrainian clubs competing in UEFA competitions will also have to play home matches at neutral venues “until further notice,” the statement said.
