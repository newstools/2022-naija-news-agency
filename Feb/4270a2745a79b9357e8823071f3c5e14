A search has been launched after a man was caught on CCTV emptying a bag of blood onto the streets of Reading. Police were called after blood was found on Broad Street, Duke Street and Jackson’s Corner in the town centre at around 7am on Tuesday morning. CCTV footage captured a man walking along Broad Street at 2.35am carrying a white plastic bag with a quantity of liquid inside, Thames Valley Police said. It showed him emptying the bag onto the ground as he passed John Lewis. Following the discovery, the area was closed off while forensics officers gathered evidence from the scene. Police have confirmed the liquid is blood and tests to establish its nature and where it came from are ongoing. The force has said there is no suggestion the blood came from an injured person and officers have found no evidence of anyone attending hospital with injuries or calling an ambulance. Owen Parker-Brunt, manager of Wolf Italian Street Food in Broad Street whose CCTV camera captured the incident, told the BBC he watched the ‘extremely unusual’ footage with a police officer after arriving at work. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T16S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/23/17/54561845-0-image-a-37_1645637115073.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-02-23T17:25:14+0000","description":"Police are searching for a man seen emptying a plastic bag full of blood on the ground in Reading town centre.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/02/23/4724828141630373632/480x270_MP4_4724828141630373632.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web
