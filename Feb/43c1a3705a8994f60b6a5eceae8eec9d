According to Ika Weekly, Sammy disclosed that he met his newly married wife, who is former Miss Stephanie Ebere Odili as a Head Girl of Orient Academy Group of School, Boji-Boji Owa during his Teaching Practice (TP) in 2013 as Economics teacher. He made the disclosure on Saturday, February 18, 2022 after his wedding to his heartthrob, Stephanie, held at Living Faith Church along the Old Lagos/Asaba Road, Agbor. According to him, “It was a dream come true that I married Stephanie whom I have so admired and cherished as one of my students. What started like a child’s play has come to reality. Indeed, I feel fulfilled that finally I got married to her, my dream wife as a secondary school student. Sincerely, I want to appreciate the Nigerian education system which has brought us together as husband and wife. My wife remains the best achievement I got during my teaching practice time, despite the fact that TP teachers are not paid for their service. I left Orient Academy Group of School finding my missing rib”. The latest groom in town enjoined youth who see education as a sc@m to desist, adding that education gave him the best gift in life, which is his wife. Responding briefly, the bride, Mrs. Stephanie Chuks, equally appreciated God for keeping them together to fulfill their destiny of becoming husband and wife, enjoining spinsters to have self control while in search of life partner rather than jumping from one boyfriend to another.
