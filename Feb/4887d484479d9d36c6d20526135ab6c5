European champions Chelsea take on the South American champs Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final on Saturday in Abu Dhabi. The Blues narrowly beat Al Hilal 1-0 thanks to a goal from Romelu Lukaku, while the Brazilians beat Egyptian side Al Aly 2-0 through Veiga and Dudu. Thomas Tuchel is back in charge of Chelsea for this one after missing the semi-final win due to Covid-19, while assistant Zsolt Low took charge. Neither club has won the competition before, with Chelsea finishing runners-up to Corinthians in 2012, while Palmeiras only managed fourth place in 2020. Tuchel’s side are looking to become the third English side to win the Club World Cup after Liverpool and Manchester United, who have both won it once. The match kicks off at 4.30pm UK time on Saturday 12 February at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi. Channel 4 will be showing the game live, with coverage beginning at 4pm and streaming available on All4.
