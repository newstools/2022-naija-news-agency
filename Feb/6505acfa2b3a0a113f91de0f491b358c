 President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has invested heavily in the revamping of Nigeria’s rail sector. First Lady, Aisha Buhari on Thursday travelled from Kaduna to Abuja by train, a move her aide said was meant to encourage more Nigerians to use that mode of transportation. It was gathered that Mrs Buhari arrived in Kaduna from Kano by air and then decided to travel by train to Abuja. She was in the company of her younger brother, Mahmud Ahmad, also known as Modi, and a few aides. Those familiar with her movement said the train left Kaduna at 4pm and arrived in Abuja at past 6pm. 9News Nigeria Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
