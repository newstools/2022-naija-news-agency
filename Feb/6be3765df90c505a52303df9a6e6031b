She had continued working, issuing a message of condolence to the Brazilian president over flooding in his country while self-isolating at Windsor Castle on Monday. The Queen celebrated her Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne on February 6 Concern for the nation’s longest-reigning sovereign is high given her age, her Covid diagnosis and recent health scare. She is believed to be triple vaccinated but until recently had been on doctors’ orders to rest and only undertake light duties since mid-October.
