 The State Department said Saturday that almost all of its 200 staff based in Kyiv will be required to leave “due to the continued threat of Russian military action.” The embassy will keep a small number of “core” diplomats in Kyiv, so the U.S. can maintain a diplomatic presence in the country. Saturday’s evacuation order follows a series of warning signs on Friday, from Biden administration officials saying an invasion could happen before the conclusion of the Olympics on Feb. 20 and the Pentagon sending 3,000 more troops to Poland. President Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday morning from Camp David. Family members of U.S. embassy staff had already been ordered to depart Kyiv, but the State Department had left it up to nonessential staff if they wanted to leave. The State Department again on Saturday urged Americans to evacuate Ukraine through private and commercial means, warning that the government would not be able to help U.S. citizens leave if Russia moves forward with military action. In the past 24 hours, multiple other countries — including Israel, Germany and the U.K. — have been encouraging their citizens to leave and reducing their diplomatic presence. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday, reiterating that “a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis remained open” if Moscow decided to deescalate and engage in diplomatic discussions. “He reiterated that should Moscow pursue the path of aggression and further invade Ukraine, it would result in a resolute, massive, and united Transatlantic response,” the readout said.
