 Steve Barclay, who runs the U.K. Cabinet Office and holds the ceremonial title Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will become the prime minister’s chief of staff, and has been put in charge of integrating the new Office of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Office. Johnson promised structural changes to the way No. 10 Downing Street operates after the senior civil servant Sue Gray highlighted “failures of leadership and judgment” in No. 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office in an abridged report probing allegations lockdown-busting gatherings had been held in government. Barclay, a former Brexit secretary, was previously Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s deputy at the Treasury. Johnson has also appointed Guto Harri, a former BBC journalist, as his new director of communications after communications director Jack Doyle quit on Thursday. Doyle was among a raft of key aides who announced they would be leaving the prime minister’s operation on Thursday. Chief of Staff Dan Rosenfield, principle private secretary Martin Reynolds and the head of the Downing Street policy unit Munira Mirza all announced their exits. Harri was Johnson’s spokesman and chief of staff during his first term as London mayor. In a press statement announcing the appointments Johnson said they would “improve how No. 10 operates, strengthen the role of my Cabinet and backbench colleagues, and accelerate our defining mission to level up the country.” Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
