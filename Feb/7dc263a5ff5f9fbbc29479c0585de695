Recall that Naija News earlier reported that the security details attached to Peller were withdrawn after he moved the motion for the dissolution of the NSCDC. In a statement signed by the Director, Public Relations at the Corps’ headquarters, DCC Olusola Odumosu, the commandant condemned the initial withdrawal of the lawmaker’s security detail as he stated that it was not within the power of the person who ordered the withdrawal to carry out such an action. The statement reads: “The leadership of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has dismissed as unauthorized and without recourse to the Corps constituted authority, a letter signed and sent to a Member of the House of Representatives, Hon Shima Peller, informing him of the withdrawal of officials of the NSCDC assigned to him. “Not only did the officer in question lacked the power to do such, he was also found to have acted on his whims without clearance. The Commandant General, Dr. Ahmed Abubakar Audi, mni, has therefore directed a reinstatement of the withdrawn officers with a compliment of necessary courtesies to the Honourable Member”.
