Naija News reports that Buni, who was represented by the Secretary of the committee, John Akpanudoedehe, swore in the chairmen for 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Akpanudoedehe, however, failed to inaugurate state chairmen for Kano and Sokoto due to the internal crisis in the two states which had resulted in parallel congresses. The APC chieftain didn’t state exact reasons for excluding the two states ahead of the party’s National Convention slated for February 26.
