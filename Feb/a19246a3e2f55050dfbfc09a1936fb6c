It was gathered that the dreaded group at the early hours of Wednesday stormed the residence of Mr Christian Kpatuma, popularly known as HIPPIES, and killed him. Naija News understands that the cultists that killed the deceased who was also a lawyer are well known in Agwa community. A source who anonymously disclosed the incident to Daily Post said indigenes of Agwa clan woke up on Wednesday morning to the devastating news of the gruesome murder of Barr. Christian Kpatuma. “The cultists, who are well known in Agwa, went to his house in the early hours of today and killed him,” the source reportedly said. He called the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma to direct security agencies to Agwa with a view to hunting the cultists and their sponsors until they are all brought to book. He decried the situation, noting that the indigenes of Agwa clan now live in great fear, in spite of the fact that her well-meaning sons and daughters suffered to build a Police Divisional Headquarters (adjudged to be one of the best in Imo State), which was commissioned barely three days ago together with a vigilante service. “I am greatly pained,” he cried out. Also reacting to the development, Mrs. Nancy Amarach, lamented that a man that was not shot by gunmen all through his service as a police officer was killed by his own people. “My heart is bleeding, our traditional rulers know what to do about this. Let’s say no to cultism, say no to killings, say no to crises, say no to stealing and say no to destruction of life and property. If they can kill big people like this, who will defend us?” She lamented. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, CSP Michael Abattam, said he has heard about it but he wants confirmation from the DPO.
