The ex-leader said Southwest leaders couldn’t use Sunday Igboho to cause cause ‘war’ in the region but are showing support for Kanu to destroy Southeast. Reacting to a recent claim by an unnamed member of IPOB that many of his loyalists were killed by some unknown gunmen in Imo state, Dokubo said it was all lie. Naija News understands that an IPOB member had last week alleged that the Governor of Imo state Hope Uzodinma contracted Dokubo to combat IPOB and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN). The individual alleged that Dokubo trained many boys, put them on N150, 000 monthly allowances, and sent about 79 of them to battle IPOB/ESN in the forest. According to him, unknown gunmen struck and killed many of Dokubo’s foot soldiers, prompting the former militant to flee to the Benin Republic. However, Dokubo on Wednesday evening during his social media broadcast, claimed he instead, killed IPOB and ESN gunmen. He said: “It is a lie. No single boy of mine died. It is your people (IPOB) that I sent to Satan (killed), their master” Dokubo said. “Your people know. All of them know how they run past their houses, past their forest. So they danced and went to attack Nigerian Army at Ihiala (in Anambra state),” the former militant added. Dokubo vowed to kill more IPOB members and their supporters if he ever encounter any of them.
