We’re used to hearing about earthquakes happening in different countries, but the UK is no stranger to the occasional tremor. The West Midlands recently experienced some seismic activity, with a 2.8 magnitude shake being recorded on Monday, February 21. According to the BGS, the quake hit the town of Walsall, near Birmingham, at a depth of seven kilometres (4.35 miles) shortly before 11pm. Residents told the BGS the quake shook their homes, with one person saying it ‘was like a wardrobe had fallen over or an explosion blast against the window’. While rare, the UK does have a history of earthquakes, with other recent quakes taking place in Blackpool and Cornwall in 2019, measuring 2.1 and 2,2 magnitude respectively. But what is the biggest earthquake ever recorded in the UK? In June 1931 in Dogger Bank in the North Sea, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1. The epicentre was 60 miles off the Yorkshire coast which radically reduced the amount of damage. The earthquake was reported felt by a number of vessels in the North Sea and a woman in Hull died of a heart attack, apparently as a result of the earthquake. You might be familiar with the Richter Scale which used to be used to measure the strength of earthquakes. However, nowadays, the Moment Scale (MW) is a the standard method used to estimate the magnitude of all large earthquakes. It’s based on the size of a fault, the distance it moved and the rigidity of the local bedrock. The Moment Scale was developed in the 1970s and is a more accurate way of describing powerful seismic activity. Earthquakes with a magnitude of three or less – like the earthquake in Stockton-on-Tees – are said to be barely noticeable to humans. The world’s largest earthquake ever recorded took place in Valdivia, Chile on 22 May 1960 and had a staggering magnitude of 9.5. It killed 1655 people, injured 3000 and displaced two million, alongside triggering a tsunami with damage felt as far as Japan, Hawaii and the Philippines. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T29S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/12/14/06/51762325-0-image-m-33_1639465129306.jpg","uploadDate":"2021-12-14T06:57:33+0000","description":"Hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 1,000km of epicentre, the US-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2021/12/14/2527202105030100179/480x270_MP4_2527202105030100179.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

                            video There are roughly 15 earthquakes of a similar size to that felt in Walsall on a yearly basis and, according to the British Geological Survey, there are 20-30 earthquakes felt in the UK every year. There are also a few hundred even smaller earthquakes each year which are picked up by sensitive machinery. Even the noticeable quakes in the UK aren’t known to cause much damage. The North Sea is more active for earthquakes than mainland Britain, and a quake with a magnitude of 4 happens approximately every two years.
