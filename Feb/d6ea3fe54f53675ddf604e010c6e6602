Call The Midwife viewers have warned they’ll ‘riot’ if Sister Julienne or Dr Turner fail to survive the devastating train crash in Sunday’s final episode. The episode ended on the two characters, played by Jenny Agutter, 69, and Stephen McCann, 59, lying unconscious after the crash, with the question of their survival hanging in the air. The dramatic scenes unfolded as their train collided with another, due to the driver suffering what appeared to be a brain haemorrhage. As viewers watched the dramatic scenes unfolding in front of them, fans flocked to Twitter to share their shock, fearing the worst.

With this being the 11th series of the BBC One hit show, viewers are left waiting for this Sunday’s upcoming reveal, after a climactic moment. Speaking to Radio Times, Thomas said: ‘The thing is, if there was a train crash near where you live, in the world of Call The Midwife, the two people you could rely on to come and sort everything out are Dr Turner and Sister Julienne. ‘But if they are in the eye of the storm, who will save them?’ As the momentous episode ended, an ominous voiceover by Vanessa Redgrave said: ‘Sometimes the sky rips open and the earth erupts beneath our feet. ‘We stand if we can stand at all, exposed, vulnerable, pathetic in our frailty.
