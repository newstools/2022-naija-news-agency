Naija News reports that she made the allegation on her Instagram page. The comedian while lamenting in a series of videos alleged that the fueling station filled her car with water instead of petrol. She noted that some of the cars immediately developed faults after their cars were filled, adding that her generators and car are  broken down because of the bad fuel. Speaking about her ordeal, Ashmusy revealed that immediately she left the fuel station her car broke down, and, to her surprise, other motorists who came out of the same filling station had similar problems. Ashmusy, who threatened to sue the filling station, also shared a video which showed the mixed fuel in bowls. Sharing the video, she wrote; “You guys don’t ever buy fuel from northwest fuel station IIaje!!They are madd Buy from them at your own risk” See photo below; <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-475725 size-full lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg" alt="" width="489" height="549" data-srcset="https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg 489w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90-267x300.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-475725 size-full lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg?resize=489%2C549&#038;ssl=1" alt width="489" height="549" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg?resize=489%2C549&#038;ssl=1 489w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90-267x300.jpg 267w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg?resize=489%2C549&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-475725 size-full lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg?resize=489%2C549&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="489" height="549" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90.jpg?resize=489%2C549&#038;ssl=1 489w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/90-267x300.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" data-recalc-dims="1">  This article was originally published on Naija News Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
