The relationship between music and love is profound – music has the ability to touch us emotionally, and those who are in love have always expressed their feelings for one another through the lyrics of a song, or a melody when words alone will not suffice. On Valentine’s Day, love is truly all around, inspiring people to take thoughtful actions, like sending gifts, setting up cosy candle-lit dinners, proposing marriage or renewing their relationship vows. One of the most vital ingredients in the day’s recipe for romance is music, with people worldwide setting the scene with songs that they love, thereby transporting their Valentine’s moment to a magical place. Making a playlist of songs is an art and can take time, so try these different playlists specially curated and released by Spotify for Valentine’s Day. <img fifu-featured="1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47683" src="https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Spotify-for-the-records.jpg?resize=740,493&amp;ssl=1" alt="Feel the Love of This Valentine’s Day with These Playlists on Spotify" title="Feel the Love of This Valentine’s Day with These Playlists on Spotify" width="740" height="493" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Spotify-for-the-records.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Spotify-for-the-records.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Spotify-for-the-records.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Spotify-for-the-records.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> First is 100 Best African Love Songs, a playlist with the best love songs from the continent from the 2000s to date, which everyone can enjoy while reminiscing where they were when a specific song was released.
