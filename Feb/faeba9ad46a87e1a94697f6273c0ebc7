 RT said in a statement that it had “applied to the Administrative Court of Berlin demanding the cancelation of the unlawful decision of the German [media] regulator which banned the broadcasting of the RT DE channel in Germany.” Last week, Germany’s media regulator announced that it would ban RT’s German-language TV channel, in a row over its license. After the German move, Moscow hit back and banned the German media outlet Deutsche Welle from operating in Russia — and escalated the situation by revoking DW journalists’ accreditation. Last December, RT went live with its German channel, but within days it was taken off air by satellite operator Eurosat and its YouTube channel was banned. German authorities ruled at that point that RT did not have the required licence to operate in the country. Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
