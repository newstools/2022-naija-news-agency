Paul Daley is preparing to bring the curtain down on a legendary career in mixed martial arts back home in the UK. A 20-year veteran of the sport, the Nottingham fighter will have one last dance against Russian hitter Andrey Koreshkov in what will be his retirement fight at Bellator London this May. It is the challenge Daley has needed. The 39-year-old admits motivation has been an issue for some time, hitting rock bottom in his last bout against Jason Jackson where he was unable to summon the passion and drive that has so often defined him. The 63-fight veteran, a pioneer of the UK MMA scene, has been contemplating retirement over the last 18 months and such has been the uncertainty over his future in the sport, he stopped sparring, abandoned training camps and instead merely went through the motions. But after witnessing Kell Brook rolled back the years against Amir Khan at the start of the month, ‘Semtex’ feels reinvigorated. Having also seen old foes bow out of the sport on their backs, he is determined to deliver one final show and believes May’s showdown in London will answer the questions he has been asking of himself. ‘I have always enjoyed training but I don’t want to keep waking up feeling like it is a chore. When that starts to happen then it is time to stop,’ Daley told Metro.co.uk. ‘The passion isn’t there and it hasn’t been there for my last couple of fights, I have just been going through the motions. I’m glad Koreshkov called me out. Him being a former champion, one of the most feared guys in the division, is a massive motivating factor here. ‘I’m plotting away now, this training camp is going to be phenomenal. Everything is going to be on point. I don’t want to go into this looking like Nick Diaz in his last fight, a shadow of his former self, flabby and out of shape. I want to be at my peak. I’m going to be more like Kell Brook was against Amir Khan. I’m hoping I’m going to maul this guy’. Ahead of his final test, Daley has planned a fight camp for the ages – one he expects will bring the best possible version of himself back to the cage. ‘This is going to me my last fight, I am not going to go in there half-arsed,’ he continued. ‘I haven’t had that motivation my last couple of fights. For this one, I am doing a lot of things I haven’t done in recent camps. You will see a different ‘Semtex’ on the scales and on fight night. I am hoping to surprise a few people’. On the Jackson fight, he added: ‘I was just going through the motions. It was a quick back-to-back fight for me. Jason Jackson isn’t a big name, I wasn’t motivated by the fight and even in the fight, I was just plodding on. He was taking me down and I didn’t have a massive desire to get back up. ‘This one is completely different. The last fight I even sparred for was Erick Silva [in June 2019]. I haven’t sparred since then, I have just been hitting pads, doing jujutsu, and running. ‘I haven’t been away for a training camp in God knows how long but I’m going away to Dubai for the final leg of the camp, all that will play a big factor.’ Daley’s final test will be against former welterweight champion Koreshkov. In case anyone had forgotten, the 31-year-old provided a chilling reminder of his ability with a victory inside 38 seconds against Chance Rencountre, crushing his opponent’s ribs and puncturing a lung with a devastating spinning back kick just last week. ðª Vintage Koreshkov!ð¦µð¥ The spinning back kick once again gets the job done for The Spartan! âï¸ Watch #Bellator274 LIVE on @SHOSports. pic.twitter.com/Tk24syPPbj — BellatorMMA (@BellatorMMA) February 20, 2022 It is the sort of test Daley says he needed – someone who will demand the absolute best of him. With his career almost up, the process of reflecting on his accomplishments has already begun. Having operated outside of the UFC for the last decade following his brief stint with the promotion, Daley feels his career has not received the recognition it deserves. His notable defeats have come against true elite operators including Douglas Lima and Rory MacDonald during his seven-year spell with Bellator having also fallen short against former welterweight king Tyron Woodley in their 2011 meeting during their time with Strikeforce. With his final test against another former world champion in Koreshkov, Daley admits he goes into it needing to prove something to himself. ‘Even though it is a retirement fight, it feels like there is so much to prove despite being in this game for 20 years,’ he said. ‘It is a chip on my shoulder. Watching what Kell Brook did, he has been a massive motivation too. Not getting that Amir Khan fight for so long was a chip on his shoulder, people always wondered whether he could beat him. I’ve had a similar problem. ‘Am I that good, am I just a journeyman, am I a world class athlete?’  Vasiliy Lomachenko enlists with Ukrainian forces to fight Russia invasion   Klitschko brothers to take up arms for Ukraine as Oleksandr Usyk returns to join fight   Josh Taylor’s controversial victory over Jack Catterall to be investigated by BBBofC  ‘Even after 20 years of fighting some of the biggest names out there on some of the biggest shows across the world people still question it and I don’t feel like I get the credit I deserve. Much like Kell. But you will see when I step on the scales that this is no joke. ‘I’ve had opportunities against champions and come up short. It would be fitting to put that right in my final fight, get that chip off my shoulder and say to myself, you know what, you are a world class fighter. ‘I am really focused on stopping this guy and ending my career as it should happen – not on my back, but absolutely smashing my opponent.’ MORE : Kell Brook stops Amir Khan in sixth round of thrilling grudge match MORE : Michael ‘Venom’ Page promises to ‘finish his journey’ in Bellator title showdown against Yaroslav Amosov before settling old score For more stories like this, check our sport page.
