Contracts are now being drawn up to finalise the arrival of the former Chelsea and Derby boss at Goodison Park. Lampard became the leading candidate on Friday after Everton held a final round of talks with three candidates. The former England midfielder had been out of work since being sacked by Chelsea in January 2021 with the club ninth in the Premier League. Everton owner Farhad Moshiri flew into London to hold talks with Lampard, Vitor Pereira and the current caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson. The Toffees had been searching for a successor to Rafael Benitez after he was sacked earlier this month in the wake of their 2-1 defeat at Norwich. The former Liverpool manager had been in charge at Goodison Park for less than seven months. Everton sit 16th in the Premier League and are just four points above the relegation zone having won one and drawn three of their last 14 matches.
