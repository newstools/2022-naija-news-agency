Have you ever enjoyed something so much you wanted to get a tattoo of it on your body forever? If so, then surely you’ll be able to relate to this Shrek fan, who went above and beyond to show her love for the film series. Eyelash technician Tymarah Emily decided on a whim to get inked with the Spotify scanning code for All Star by Smash Mouth at her friend’s tattoo studio. In a clip shared on TikTok, you can see the 23-year-old getting at various stages of the process – getting the stencil done, going under the needle, and testing the code to see if it actually works. And reader, it does. Situated on the back of her left arm, the code starts playing the iconic opening song from the first Shrek film when scanned. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T12S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/19/14/53119403-0-image-a-13_1642603981043.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-01-19T14:51:53+0000","description":"Let's hope Spotify is still going in 30 years' time.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/01/19/1897287022084272952/480x270_MP4_1897287022084272952.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Tymarah wrote over the video: ‘When you definitely just made the best decision of your life ‘Tell me I’m wrong?’ ‘One of my friends is a tattoo artist and she has her own shop,’ Tymarah explained. ‘She does some unreal tattoos, some amazing bits of art on me and all her other work too. ‘We were doing a new arm tattoo with me and I have this ongoing joke with my friends that I’d do it and to be fair I do really like Shrek. ‘I love the song All Star by Smash Mouth, and we thought it would be funny and really cool to get the Spotify logo and the song code. ‘We had joked about it before and then I was having my forearm done, and after I was like “shall we do it?” ‘So we printed it out, stencilled it and then made sure it worked with the stencil on my arm. ‘It would have been even more funny if I had the tattoo and then it didn’t work.’  How to deal with someone just not liking you   What to do if you’ve let ‘date nights’ slip in your relationship   This tiny £70k house’s layout is making people feel queasy  Since she shared the clip, it’s earned over 5million views and more than 300,000 likes.
