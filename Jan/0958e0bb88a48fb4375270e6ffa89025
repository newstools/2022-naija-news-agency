 According to Chinwe Lilian Okafor, her niece’s fiancé picked her up on the 25th of December 2021 while claiming to be taking her to his parents. Things got a little alarming when he went down a lonely road and began making odd phone calls that his fiancée couldn’t hear. The lady who appeared to be lucky, on the other hand, took advantage of the opportunity she had to flee when the man left her in his car while he had a conversation with his counterparts. Read the rest of the story here: “My niece was almost used for ritual on the 25th December 2021.Her fiance picked her up to go see his parents, on their way to his village he diverted to a narrow and lonely road.They drove for several hours until she started questioning him. He claimed that his parents were not home yet, so let them go visit some friends before proceeding.The young man was always on a strange call and whenever this call comes in, he will quietly step down from the vehicle and answer the call.They got to a point, he stopped and started making some funny calls.. My niece over heard his conversation and tried to escape, he caught her, seized her phone and handbag then locked her inside the vehicle until they got to a shrine.They were other girls there tied, fortunately for her, she wasn’t tied. As luck would have it, her fiance and some other guys(about three of them) stepped out for further discussions and that was how she escaped and ran through a thick forest until she got to the road.Since then, she’s yet to recover from the shock.So many girls are tied up there and other girls will join soon.Who are your friends?How much do you know who you are dating?Carry out due diligence on that person before saying I do!Things are happening…I said it before and will say it again, ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD!Thank God for saving my niece.” The post How my niece escaped being used for ritual by her fiancé – Lady narrates appeared first on Expressive Info.
