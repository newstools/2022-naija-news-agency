The Senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly said this during a press briefing in Abuja on Monday where he officially announced his 2023 presidential ambition. Okorocha promised to use his time as president to mentor the youths for leadership positions, adding that he would provide jobs for unemployed youths. “To the youths, If I become your president, I will hand over power to the next generation. I’m not not-too-young-to-run and not too old to run, I’m only 57 “I created 25,000 jobs for the youths. I made 305 millionaires in Imo,” he said. The former Imo governor also promised to tackle various challenges that will face the country, if elected to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. He said: “Please permit to be your pilot for a new Nigeria, as your pilot there might be small turbulence, no problem, captain Rochas is in command.” This online platform reports that this will be the fourth shot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain at the presidency. It will be recalled that Okorocha had earlier written a letter to the Senate about his intention. The letter was read during the plenary last Wednesday by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. Apart from Okorocha, other politicians from the South East who have shown interest in the 2023 presidency include; Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, former Senate President and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, and others.
