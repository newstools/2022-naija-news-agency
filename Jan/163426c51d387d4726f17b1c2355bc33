Trump while teasing a potential 2024 presidential bid during a campaign-style rally in Texas on Saturday evening, January 29, claimed that his supporters who broke into the Capitol last year are being treated ‘unfairly’ by President Joe Biden. ‘If I run, and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,’ he said to enthusiastic applause. ‘If that requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.’.  <img class="img-responsive text-center lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt='  "They' border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" data-cfstyle="margin: auto;border:0px solid black; height:320px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-top:0px; width:470px" data-cfsrc="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><img fifu-featured="1" class="img-responsive text-center lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Trump says he would pardon January 6 Capitol rioters that have been jailed if he’s re-elected" title="Trump says he would pardon January 6 Capitol rioters that have been jailed if he’s re-elected" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" data-cfstyle="margin: auto;border:0px solid black; height:320px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-top:0px; width:470px" data-cfsrc="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img fifu-featured="1" class="img-responsive text-center lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Trump says he would pardon January 6 Capitol rioters that have been jailed if he’s re-elected" title="Trump says he would pardon January 6 Capitol rioters that have been jailed if he’s re-elected"They' border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" data-cfstyle="margin: auto;border:0px solid black; height:320px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-top:0px; width:470px" data-cfsrc="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ee3898d00295e9f207406ee39abbeaa9.jpeg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"> He also took aim at the Democrat-led House committee investigating the riot before turning his anger back to how the detainees are being treated. ‘This hasn’t happened to all of the other atrocities that took place recently, what that un-select committee is doing and what the people are doing who are running those prisons — it’s a disgrace,’ Trump said. ’We will treat them fairly and we will take care of the people of this country.’ Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
