Meena Jutla’s (Paige Sandhu) reign of terror will soon come to an end in Emmerdale. Throughout 2021, Meena has been murdering, manipulating and holding residents hostage. Towards the end of 2021, Manpreet (Rebecca Sarker) discovered her sister was an evil and twisted soul but paid the price by being tortured and kidnapped. Right now, viewers are wondering whether Meena has really killed Manpreet after an episode aired that saw her drag a body bag into the boot. Elsewhere this week, Vinny (Bradley Johnson) wondered if Meena had something to do with Ben’s death, after realising her name was cropping up an awful lot during his (not very thorough) investigation. As lives still remain in danger, Meena is aware more people are getting closer to discovering who she really is. Taking action, Meena decided to bury her trophy box on Liam’s (Jonny McPherson) allotment, aware that if the police searched her room, they could find the proof she was responsible for killing Leanna, Ben and Andrea. As time ticks away for Meena, Paige Sandhu has reflected on what it’s been like to play this murderous character: ‘I love her, I think she’s hilarious. She’s got so much charisma. She’s so strange! She’s just odd – everything about her. The things that she says and the way that she says them. But I love that. ‘She’s just weird!’, Paige laughs as she continues the chat. ‘It’s so much fun to play such a weird character. I think going to those dark places can be really fulfilling, but her slightly comedic edge is always fun. I love her flamboyancy, and I love everything about her. ‘I’ll miss everything to be honest’.
