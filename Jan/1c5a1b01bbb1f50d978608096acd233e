Novak Djokovic is set to discover if he’ll be preparing to defend his crown at the Australia Open later this month or if he’s set to be deported from the country. The world No.1 is awaiting the outcome of his appeal after his visa was denied earlier this week upon arriving in Melbourne ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year, due to begin on January 17. At 10am local time in Melbourne (Sunday 11pm UK time) the Federal Circuit Court will proceed between Djokovic and the Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews. The Serb, who has been placed in a detention hotel since landing in Melbourne, will get the chance to argue his case for his visa to be reinstated having previously been granted a medical exemption by Tennis Australia to compete at the Australian Open. Australia still has Covid rules banning most foreigners from entering the country but Djokovic applied for a ‘temporary activity’ visa, which allows foreigners in for major events. It’s unclear if Djokovic has been vaccinated against coronavirus or not, but his medical exemption has been granted upon his lawyers saying he had a bout of Covid confirmed by a PCR test on December 16. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T1M22S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/06/13/52616233-0-image-a-6_1641477017002.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-01-06T13:46:52+0000","description":"Dijana also claimed that his detention for visa irregularities was a 'political attack'.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/01/06/3799670022748458783/480x270_MP4_3799670022748458783.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video However, border officials cancelled his visa upon the 34-year-old arriving in Australia, stating under federal rules a prior infection was not a valid reason to enter without a vaccination. While proceedings will begin at 10am in Melbourne it’s unclear exactly how long it will take for a decision to be reached, However, a decision needs to be made by 4pm local time (3am Monday UK time) as that is the deadline he has been given and he can be deported thereafter.
