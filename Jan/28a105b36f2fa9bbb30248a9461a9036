Key players like Taiwo Awoniyi, Ola Aina and goalkeeper Maduka Okoye were all rested for the game by the coach. As a result of the victory, the Super Eagles will remain in the city of Garou where they will welcome their next opponent in the first knock-out round. Egypt also qualified for the next round from Group D despite losing their first match to Nigeria. They defeated Sudan on Wednesday night after a previous victory against Guinea-Bissau in their second group game. Nigeria is gunning for a fourth AFCON trophy in Cameroon this year and there is a growing feeling that the Super Eagles can go all the way in the tournament this time.
