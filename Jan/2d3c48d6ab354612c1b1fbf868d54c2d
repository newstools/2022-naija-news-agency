The case of an e-scooter rider severely injured after being clipped by a London bus is set to become a major legal test for hundreds of thousands who use them illegally on British roads. Only people riding officially rented e-scooters are legally allowed on public roads, with private two wheelers only permitted on private land. That means there are major legal questions around compensation for anyone injured on a public road, even if the fault lay purely with the driver of a vehicle. Crashes are on the increase, with new figures showing e-scooters were involved in 258 collisions in London in the first six months of 2021 – compared with just nine during the whole of 2018. The Metropolitan Police data, obtained by Labour’s London Assembly policing and crime spokesman Unmesh Desai, also revealed there were just 38 incidents in 2019, rising to 266 in 2020. The man hit when being overtaken by the bus is not being named but is in his fifties and sustained multiple fractured ribs, a dislocated right shoulder and a collapsed lung, followed by pneumonia, The Times reported. A worker in the health and beauty sector, he was wearing a hi-visibility jacket and a helmet when the incident took place on a summer’s morning last year, the paper added. His legal team, from Bolt Burdon Kemp (BBK), are seeking tens of thousands of pounds of compensation from the bus company’s insurers after their client had an extended stay in hospital. He still has problems with arm movements and chest pain. Ben Pepper, an associate solicitor at BBK, said: ‘My client took sensible precautions and was riding his e-scooter safely when a bus driver knocked him down, causing very serious injury. If he had been riding a bicycle instead, it is likely that he would have suffered similar injuries. ‘Why should his claim for compensation be any less valid than a cyclist’s claim?’ Calling for new legislation, Mr Pepper added: ‘This claim is significant as it crystallises a growing problem: e-scooters are on our roads with a lack of adequate laws to keep people safe. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png" class="thumbnail-link-image lazyload" alt="Star Hobson's killer 'joked to inmates that she's buried three more babies'" height="75" width="100" data-src="https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PRC_217748120.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png?resize=100%2C75&#038;ssl=1" class="thumbnail-link-image lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" alt="Star Hobson&#039;s killer &#039;joked to inmates that she&#039;s buried three more babies&#039;" height="75" width="100" data-src="https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PRC_217748120.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png?resize=100%2C75&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png?resize=100%2C75&#038;ssl=1" class="thumbnail-link-image lazyload" alt="Star Hobson's killer 'joked to inmates that she's buried three more babies'" height="75" width="100" data-src="https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PRC_217748120.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1" data-recalc-dims="1"> Star Hobson’s killer ‘joked she’s buried three more babies’ ‘We hope this case will help to give some clarity to the legal position for those injured in e-scooter accidents where the privately owned e-scooter was being ridden on a public road.’ The case could set a precedent for how future incidents are dealt with in the courts. In the capital, owners who want to retrieve e-scooters seized by police must pay a £150 fee plus a £10 per day storage charge, according to Mr Desai. Some 3,637 privately-owned e-scooters were seized by the officers between January and November 2021. Dozens of legalised e-scooter rental schemes have been launched in towns and cities across Britain since July 2020 as part of Government trials, including in London in June 2021.

Transport for London (TfL) banned private e-scooters on its network last month after one burst into flames on the Underground at Parsons Green Tube station. Mr Desai added: ‘The use of illegal e-scooters on our roads and pavements is putting Londoners at risk of significant harm, especially the most vulnerable in our communities such as people with limited mobility, visual impairments and hearing loss. ‘Whilst it is concerning that these figures are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg, it has been encouraging to see the scale of enforcement action taken by TfL and the Met Police so far. ‘My message to Londoners is that the only legal way to use an e-scooter in the capital is through the trial being run by TfL and London councils in certain boroughs.’ Meanwhile, a 74-year-old e-scooter rider was killed on New Year’s Day when he crashed into two parked cars in Tameside, Greater Manchester.
