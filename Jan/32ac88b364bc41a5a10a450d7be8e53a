Emmerdale’s ground-breaking episodes are always a huge success. As the pandemic began, the ITV soap aired special episodes that looked at character’s lives during the first lockdown. Last year, the villagers welcomed Drag Race UK star The Vivienne for the soap’s first ever Pride event. A few years ago, another outstanding episode aired that focused on Ashley Thomas’ battle with dementia and this year, things are no different. During a chat with Emmerdale bosses Jane Hudson and Laura Shaw, Metro.co.uk and other press were given a hint as to what viewers can expect during this special one-off episode. ‘We’re never ones to shy away from stepping outside of our comfort zone and usual storytelling style’, Laura Shaw said. ‘I can definitely tell you that we do have a very special episode coming up, which we’re about to start shooting quite soon actually. ‘This episode is going to spark off one of our biggest stories for this year, but in a different way. It’s something we’ve not done before, and it’ll enable the audience to see the story from a whole different perspective to usual. I don’t think I can say much more than that without giving it away!’ If you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.
