Reno shared his thoughts via his Instagram page. The media personality told the youths to form teams and spend their money in campaigning for their preferred candidate. He stressed the importance of voting on election day, maintaining that rigging is only possible when people do not vote. He wrote: “Dear Nigerian youths, the 2023 elections are almost here. Approach it like you did with #BBNaija. Form teams for your preferred candidate. Spend your money campaigning for them. Broadcast their manifestos to all your contacts. “Forget about rice and pay the price for your future. Don’t be BBNaija wise and Aso Rock foolish! You say your PVC does not count. Who told you? Rigging is only successful when there is low voter turnout out. But where there is a high voter turnout, rigging is all but impossible. “You waited patiently until the BBNaija phone lines were open for voting. Now, prepare to wait patiently in line, until the PVC machine reads you vote!” <img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-469114 aligncenter lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="300" data-srcset="https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg 172w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-588x1024.jpg 588w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-768x1337.jpg 768w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-882x1536.jpg 882w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-469114 aligncenter lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg?resize=172%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt width="172" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg?resize=172%2C300&#038;ssl=1 172w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-588x1024.jpg 588w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-768x1337.jpg 768w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-882x1536.jpg 882w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50.jpg 1080w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg?resize=172%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-469114 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg?resize=172%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="172" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-172x300.jpg?resize=172%2C300&#038;ssl=1 172w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-588x1024.jpg 588w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-768x1337.jpg 768w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50-882x1536.jpg 882w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e599772cd50.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-recalc-dims="1"> This article was originally published on Naija News Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
