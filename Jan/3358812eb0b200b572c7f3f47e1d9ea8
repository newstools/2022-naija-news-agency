 When the governor was asked if he was threatened that other governors who also have presidential interest are also defecting to the ruling APC to compete, Umahi said that he doesn’t feel threatened, that he is rather impressed because that gives his party a higher chance of winning the elections in 2023. Also, when he was asked if he feels endangered after the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) threatened to pull down governors who defected from their party, governor Umahi said the matter is still in court and he has nothing to worry about.
