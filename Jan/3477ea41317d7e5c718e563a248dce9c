Recall that operatives of NDLEA a few day ago invaded the residence of skit maker and thereafter arrested him over drug-related issues. NDLEA dragged Degeneral and a cinematographer, William to court, for unlawfully dealing in 15g of Cannabis and 14g of tramadol. Justice Daniel Osiagor of a Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday convicted Degeneral and William, but ruled that the volume of the substance found on them is minimal and he would rather convict the defendants and caution them, rather than sentence them. Degeneral following his release denied being a drug trafficker, adding that he wouldn’t have been released if he was one. He further stated that he would return to making skit immediately.
