Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden)’s crimes have finally caught up with him and the EastEnders tough guy faces a long stretch in prison. It looks like even the legendary legal expertise of Mitchell family solicitor Ritchie Scott isn’t going to be able to save him this time. Phil is aware of how long a stretch he’s facing, but he’s been keeping the information away from his nearest and dearest – particularly Kat (Jessie Wallace). In upcoming episodes he even goes so far as to break up with Kat, not wanting to put her through the pain of standing by him. It’s Sharon (Letitia Dean) who gets Phil to admit the truth of what’s going on – he’s facing a life sentence. He’s going to be a very old hard man indeed before he’s next around to cause mayhem on the Square. When Sharon realises that Phil hasn’t told any of this to Kat, she tells him he’s got to talk to her and tell her the truth straight away – or she will. Will Phil reveal the truth to Kat? And will she stand by him? If you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.
