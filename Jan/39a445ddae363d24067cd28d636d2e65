The North London side are yet to sign a new player during the transfer window, with few hours left for the market to close. Arteta and the club’s sporting director, Edu have missed some great signings this winter including Dusan Vlahovic who has joined Juventus, while Arthur Melo stayed in Turin. The Gunners have identified alternatives, but it seems unsure if Arsenal would be able to seal a deal before the market ends. Nikolaj Moller is set to spend the remainder of the season with Eerste Divisie side FC Den Bosch, while the club former captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also expected to leave the club on deadline day. Barcelona has emerged as the favourite to sign the striker, but his salary remains a stumbling block for the Spanish side to seal the deal. If Arsenal disposes of Aubameyang, the club will look at bringing a new striker on the deadline day. Dominic Calvert-Lewin of Everton, Lille’s Jonathan David and Real Sociedad forward Alexander Isak are all potential alternatives and either of them cannot be ruled out.
