 Earlier this week, three Nigerian startups – Moni, Topship and IdentityPass – were listed amongst the tech startups that would be funded in this year’s W22 accelerator programme. Dojah has now been listed bringing the number of Nigerian tech startups to a total of 4. The company intends to use its funding to expand to other African countries and at the same time help other African startups to gain access to more countries. Dojah is a tech company that specializes in providing a digital means of identification and verification across Africa in order to aid the seamless authentication of data. The company offers a means to validate user identities through means like liveness check, biometric verification and validating IDs with OTPs. The company was founded in 2021 by Tobiloba Ololade and Ayomide Oso who while in the course of their jobs identified the problems in the verification and identification process in Nigeria and Africa and sought to bring a solution to it and created Dojah to make identity and verification processes easier by leveraging access to Application Programming Interface (API). Ayomide Oso, Product Lead and Co-founder at Dojah on getting into the accelerator programme said, “Getting into YC has been a tremendous boost for us. It has already been instrumental in helping us ease conversations with critical stakeholders. We are excited about what the future holds for us. Our growth translates to more growth for the African Startups.” The post Dojah joins other Nigerian tech startups in the W22 Y combinator program appeared first on Nairametrics.
