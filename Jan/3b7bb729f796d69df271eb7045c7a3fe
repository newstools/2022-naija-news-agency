This Morning goes live to Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions as Boris Johnson looks set to address an email appearing to show Number 10 staff encouraged to attend a garden party – at the height of the pandemic in 2020. Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield informed fans the show would join Prime Minister’s Questions at midday, in order to see Mr Johnson challenged over rumours of a gathering in May 2020. Previously leaked emails alleged a ‘Bring Your Own Booze’ party was held in the garden of Downing Street on May 20, 2020, with 100 staff members invited. They were told in a leaked email to ‘make the most of the weather’ whilst the UK was in the midst of a lockdown during the first wave of the Covid pandemic. At the time, members of the public were only allowed to meet one other person outdoors. Mr Johnson failed to turn up to the House of Commons to face Deputy Opposition Leader Angela Rayner’s urgent question to the PM yesterday. So, PMQs will be sure to feature a tense showdown between the Prime Minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer as he’s quizzed on the scandal.
