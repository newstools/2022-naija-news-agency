The suspect’s confession read further: “The things he would need to prepare a concoction with are his thumbs, his hair, fingers and a passport photograph. “So, we went back home and thought about it, then my mother suggested that we use my younger brother since he is just 21 years old. “She also brought the poison which we gave him to eat. He died within 20minutes after consuming the food. I was the one who cut out the body parts needed.
