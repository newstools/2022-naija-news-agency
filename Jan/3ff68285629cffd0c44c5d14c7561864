Tim has been acting out of sorts as of late, which Sally has picked up on, and she’s started to suspect that he’s cheating on her with someone else. Next week, she begins to investigate in more detail, and with all the signs pointing to an affair, she wastes little time in asking Tim outright if he’s seeing someone behind her back! Tim is stunned by his wife’s line of questioning, but will he tell her the REAL reason he’s upset? Viewers will know that he’s struggling to come to terms with the fact that he needs a triple bypass heart operation. Aggie Bailey (Lorna Laidlaw) has pleaded with him to tell Sally about what he’s going through. Tim, however, reckons Sally has enough on her plate. Sally, meanwhile, soon comes to doubt her belief about Tim cheating, but the above scene – taken from Friday’s (January 21) edition of the ITV serial drama – makes her think otherwise.
