Global Citizen CEO, Hugh Evans has indicated an interest in working with Burna Boy on his idea for a charity concert in the UK with proceeds meant for the less-privileged in Africa.

The Global Citizen project, also known as the Global Poverty Project is an international education and advocacy organization established to catalyze the movement to end extreme poverty. Sharing his plans for the stadium concert in the UK this year, Burna Boy explained in a post last year that he got the idea after watching the classic movie, Bohemian Rhapsody. He likened his idea to the Live Aid concept and called on the British government and the Global Citizen Project to lend their full support to the cause.
