Arewa youths made the call in a statement titled, “Private Sector Players to Join the 2023 Presidential Race,” and jointly signed by its Speaker, Mohammed Danlami and National Clerk, Desmond Minakaro. The group wondered why those in the private sector and those who have built a career for themselves would leave the running of the country to unqualified individuals. According to the Arewa Youths, people like Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Mike Adenuga, among others, should rescue Nigeria from its current state by contesting in the 2023 election. The group noted that Nigeria should not be left to the present crop of politicians, adding that those in the private sector have the managerial acumen and leadership skills the country needs. The statement reads partly: “In a country like Nigeria that has great and intelligent minds with positive reputations all over the world, the likes of Mrs. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Mrs Ibukun Awosika, Bode Augusto, Segun Agbaje, Fola Adeola, Tunde Folawiyo, Mr. Atedo Peterside, Kola Adesina, Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, Mr. Mike Adenuga, Mr Akinwumi Adesina, Herbert Wigwe and Aig Imoukhuede, who are boardroom czars with a vast wealth of knowledge on entrepreneurship, why let Nigeria be run by others who lack such knowledge?” Arewa Youths Assembly stated that these individuals are already employer of labour and will create employment. “We are calling and pleading with the successful private sector players to join the 2023 presidential race, they need to stand up and be counted,” they added.
