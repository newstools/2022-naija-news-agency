The bloody body of a dog seems to have been padlocked into a suitcase and dumped into a river. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) has launched an investigation into what happened to the animal after a dog walker spotted the trgaic scene. The pet-owner found the pink luggage around the River Mersey, near the Speke and Garston coastal reserve, in Liverpool on Tuesday When she looked closer, she found that the case was ripped and had a dog’s body inside of it. Animal rescue Inspector Anthony Joynes said the pet – which was not microchipped – had been hurt on his nose and mouth. Now, the RSPCA is trying to trace the owner of the young male dog. The suitcase is bright pink and has the name ‘Chantell’ written in black marker on the side. This is the only clue investigators have. He said: ‘I am treating this as suspicious as the dog had blood loss from his nose and mouth suggesting a blunt force trauma incident to the head could have caused the death of the dog. ‘The fact the body was put in a suitcase which was padlocked and thrown into the river is also suspicious. ‘Sometimes these injuries can be from road traffic accidents but x-rays have found no broken bones which would be expected – and the way the body was disposed of is clearly unusual. ‘I am now keen to trace the owners of this dog and am appealing for anyone with information to get in touch. ‘I think the body had been in the river only for a short period looking at the fact there was little decomposition.’ Anyone with information should call the RSPCA appeals line on 0800 123 8018.
