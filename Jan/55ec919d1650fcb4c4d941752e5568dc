Oral was released after the third episode of the current season of Undercover called by her mother.  “You should know that my mother never calls me, I always call her,” says the actress in conversation with The newspapaer.  “Okay, I thought, what is this about?  And then she burst out: she had to Undercover watched and I had a sex scene.  Do you need that, she asked, I can give you money, right?” The actress then did something that her mother “didn’t expect at all”.  “Instead of saying sorry or looking for excuses, I said, ‘Mom, I really don’t understand what you’re so worried about.  I didn’t do anything wrong, I even discussed this with my fiancé.  I said: my back is straight and my forehead is open;  that’s a turkish saying.  I even said that I thought that reaction was a bit retarded.” Sunday is the last episode of the third season of Undercover to be seen on Netflix.
