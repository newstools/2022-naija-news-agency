Edward Norton has paid tribute to his Fight Club co-star Meat Loaf, describing him as a ‘sweet soul’ Today, it was announced that Meat Loaf – who was born Marvin Lee Aday and changed his name to Michael – had died at the age of 74. In addition to his illustrious musical career, the late singer was also a talented actor, appearing in The Rocky Horror Picture Show as Eddie and making a cameo in Spice World as bus driver Dennis. In 1999, the Bat Out Of Hell singer starred in Fight Club as Bob Paulson, who the Narrator (played by Norton) first meets at a support group for men with testicular cancer. Norton paid homage to his late cast mate in a couple of posts shared on Twitter, the first of which featured a picture of their Fight Club characters embracing in the support group scene. ‘I don’t keep pictures from films around home. But I have this one in my office in a frame bc it makes me smile every time,’ he said. I donât keep pictures from films around home. But I have this one in my office in a frame bc it makes me smile every time. Itâs engraved âLove and Hugs, Meatâ it sums him up well. He was so funny. And gentle. And warm to everyone. A sweet soul. RIP Meat Loaf pic.twitter.com/aMrIgXByEc — Edward Norton (@EdwardNorton) January 21, 2022 ‘It’s engraved “Love and Hugs, Meat” it sums him up well. He was so funny. And gentle. And warm to everyone. A sweet soul. RIP Meat Loaf.’ In a second post, Norton shared another still from the film, when the Narrator and Bob are staring at each other. ‘To us he will always be “Bob”,’ the actor said. ‘Those were some wonderful months of laughter & irreverence. The hardest thing about working w/ Meat was getting through any of these ridiculous moments without cracking up. Him lying on the table playing dead then belting out Zeppelin. Good times.’ To us he will always be âBobâ. Those were some wonderful months of laughter & irreverence.

Good times ð pic.twitter.com/ZKnf7tPpAs — Edward Norton (@EdwardNorton) January 21, 2022 Following Meat Loaf’s death, musician Boy George tweeted about a hilarious encounter he shared with him, writing: ‘R.I.P Meatloaf. Love and prayers to all his family and close friends. He once turned me upside down in a Chinese Restaurant in St Johns Wood.’ Alice Cooper hailed Meat Loaf as ‘one of the greatest voices in Rock N Roll’, adding that he was ‘certainly one of my closest friends in the business’. The singer said: ‘He was really so much fun, truly fun to be around. He just felt like a best friend to everyone no matter how long it had been since you last saw him. We worked together many times over the years and he was always a force. ‘He was a real theatrical character like I was so our shows went really well together. I remember when you would see his show, he would treat the audience almost like a Pentecostal Preacher and he was so powerful on stage.’  Meat Loaf ‘died after catching Covid-19’ as tributes pour in   Iconic singer and actor Meat Loaf dies aged 74   Machine Gun Kelly’s engagement ring for Megan Fox could hurt her, designer confirms  Meat Loaf died on Thursday night with his wife Deborah at his side, with a statement reading: ‘Daughters Pearl and Amanda and close friends have been with him throughout the last 24 hours.’ The announcement added: ‘We thank you for your understanding of our need for privacy at this time.
