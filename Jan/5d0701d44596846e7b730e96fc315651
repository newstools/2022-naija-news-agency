We also talk to conservative Polish MEP Patryk Jaki about his government’s clashes with Brussels. POLITICO’s Charlie Duxbury joins the podcast panel from Latvia to report on how people in the Baltic nation are dealing with the prospects of a new war in their neighborhood. He’s joined by podcast regulars Andrew Gray and Matthew Karnitschnig to explore whether the tension over Ukraine is moving traditionally neutral Sweden and Finland closer to NATO membership. Our U.K. political correspondent Annabelle Dickson unpacks Boris Johnson’s strategy when it comes to Ukraine and how party scandals surrounding the PM may be playing into things. Our special guest is Patryk Jaki, a conservative member of the European Parliament from Poland. Jaki spoke to POLITICO’s Jan Cienski about how he got his start in politics, as well as rule-of-law concerns and Poland’s approach to climate change. Asked for viewing and reading recommendations for our listeners, Jaki picked this Karate Kid sequel on Netflix, as well as this spiritual biography of an American conservative political icon. The podcast crew also has a few tips of their own. Matt marks a somber date in history with a film recommendation. Charlie picks a Danish crime thriller that’s not for the faint-hearted. Andrew promises this Tartan Noir crime novel will keep you guessing in more ways than one. And Annabelle is wrapping up this BBC podcast on the rise of extremism in modern America.
