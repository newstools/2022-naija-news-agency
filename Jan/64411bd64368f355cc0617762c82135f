First Dates viewers were left confused after Fred Sirieix appeared to have a chinwag with two of the contestants in the ladies’ toilet. Sisters Merritt and Emma went on dates with Miles and Damani on the show, and called each other into the toilets to have a debrief on how it was going. Both girls were excited about how well their nights were going, and they were joined by maître d’ Fred as they popped to the loo. Emma and Merritt squealed with joy at the fact Miles had bought Merritt a cactus instead of cut flowers – which she hates – seeing a promising future for the pair of them. Viewers took to Twitter to share their confusion at why Fred ended up in the same toilet, tweeting: ‘Erm, why is Fred hanging around in the Ladies?’ Others added: ‘Why is Fred in the ladies’ bog?’, ‘Why is Fred in the ladies loo?’ and ‘Fred just hanging around the toilets for the gossip there.’ Both smitten! #FirstDates pic.twitter.com/R4DZR9Ocjm — Channel 4 (@Channel4) January 6, 2022 Erm, why is Fred hanging around in the Ladies?#FirstDates — Lee Montgomery (@leemonty5) January 6, 2022 #FirstDates Why is Fred in the ladies’ bog? — Ken Barlow (@I_am_KenBarlow) January 6, 2022 Fred just casually hanging out in the ladies then ð half expected him to join in with their excitement at the plant. #firstdates pic.twitter.com/hVNPggCvaz — ð®ð½ð¶ðð (@SmushS) January 6, 2022 Fred just hanging around the toilets for the gossip there ð¤£ #FirstDates — MissMiaw (@MissMiaw) January 6, 2022 Fred lurking around the lavvy there, waiting for the Goss #firstdates — Helen Bristow (@HelsBels2525) January 6, 2022 Stop saying Fred was in the ladies ffs it’s obviously a unisex bog.
