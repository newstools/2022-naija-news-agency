 Ms Adichie who was in Lagos over the weekend for an event was playing the role of Cupid after the boyfriend brought her a book to sign for his girlfriend, Rachael who is a fan of the author. After the book had been signed, someone who probably came with the man and was recording, told Chimamanda to send a video message to Rachael. So, the author jokingly tells Rachael to “consider” her man and “manage” him for the nice gesture. Rachel took to Twitter to reveal that the gesture made her day as she shared the video online.
