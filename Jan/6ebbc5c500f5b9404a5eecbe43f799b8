Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly revealed the way they were able to hint to contestants they might be on the ‘wrong track’ with answers and avoid a telling off from producers in Limitless Win The pair’s new quiz show begins tonight on ITV, promising high-stakes drama and a whole load of cash to be won over the next five weeks. Limitless Win is the world’s first game show with a so-called ‘limitless’ jackpot, where contestants – in theory – have the ability to take home millions of pounds, as long as they keep getting questions correct. Viewers will see the thrilling format offer contestants an endless money ladder, which they must climb by answering questions correctly. Fans tuning in will soon discover the questions require a lot of guesswork, and a whole load of luck, as players try to achieve an ‘exact’ answer. But with Ant and Dec always on-hand to help guide the players through, Dec admitted to a tactic he and his co-host used to help contestants stay in the game. Speaking to Metro.co.uk and other press, the star explained: ‘There were a few questions as well, where they went off on the wrong track and, not that we know the answer, but you kind of have a good idea that they’re on the wrong track with this. ‘So our kind of way of dealing with that is – and you might see this on the show – we always go, “Guys just read the question again!” This helped them try and avoid a telling off from producers in their ear, due to the limited amount of guidance they are able to give players. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T1M","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/06/16/52623159-0-image-a-45_1641487080911.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-01-06T16:35:28+0000","description":"The five-part series features the world's first ever limitless jackpot and a money ladder that neveru2026 everu2026 ends.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/01/06/7601813264785230433/480x270_MP4_7601813264785230433.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video He continued: ’Because we’re not allowed to help, really, because of the money involved and all that. ‘So the producers are in your ear saying, “You can’t guide them, you can’t do that!” ‘If we ever go, “Guys just read the question again!” that means we think you’re on the wrong track. But he made sure to add: ‘That’s about as helpful as we can get. Just make them read the question again!’ Elsewhere, the pair joked the feared ‘bankrupting ITV’ due to the huge prize pot available to those taking part. Dec explained: ‘At the end of the show, we don’t go, “Okay and now it’s time to play for tonight’s Grand Prize!” because there isn’t one.
