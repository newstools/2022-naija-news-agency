The group was reacting to a report by Naija News on Monday that the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his decision to contest the 2023 presidency. In a statement by its Director-General, Oladele Nihi, the group advised Tinubu to shelve his ambition of becoming the President of the country in 2023 and support the candidacy of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. It said the country needs a youthful candidate that can tackle the numerous challenges facing the country, unite every section of the country and make the people prosperous. The group stated that one of its reasons for asking Tinubu to step down is the clamour by Nigerian youths for thorough inclusiveness and active participation in governance in the country. “Why decide to achieve a supposed lifelong ambition at a time Nigerian youths are collectively clamouring for thorough inclusiveness and active participation in governance across the board? “Why put his interest above that of the Nigerian youths who obviously constitute the majority of both Nigeria population and electorates; a united generation of like-minds who will stop at nothing to achieve a set objective? “Why has Baba (Tinubu) kept this lifelong ambition to himself all these while his age group and generation have done nothing but little to get the country working? “We, therefore, on behalf of Nigerian youth appealing to our National Leader to halt his intentions of informing Nigerians about this “lifelong ambition”, for we are not ready to cooperate; as our yearnings and cry for power would not be cowed by any sudden lifelong ambitions and mostly not by the older citizens of this country,” the group said.
