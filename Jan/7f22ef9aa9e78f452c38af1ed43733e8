Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor) is a bit of a loose cannon in Coronation Street, not that we needed to tell you that. And when there is a dramatic situation in her life, with stakes as high as they can be, she ends up getting herself into serious trouble. For over a month, Tim has been hiding a secret heart condition, which he steadily found out was very serious indeed and needed a bypass to sort. When Sally eventually found out, she was hurt and as Tim heads to the hospital to face his operation, he worries he won’t see his wife again. Speaking to Kevin Webster (Michael le Vell), Tim panics at the thought of dying without saying goodbye and he implores the mechanic to assure Sally that he is sorry and he loves her. A nervous Tim is wheeled through to the theatre but he suddenly hears a commotion. Sally has arrived and is causing chaos – to the point where she is arrested. Tim is operated on and when he comes round, he is in a daze and wonders if Sally’s arrest was all a dream. But no, it wasn’t. Has she been handcuffed over her controversial New Year widdle? And will the couple reunite in the wake of Tim making it through the triple heart bypass?
