Desperate Dotty Cotton (Milly Zero) will make an offer to Vinny Panesar (Shiv Jalota) in upcoming EastEnders episodes, but poor Vinny has no idea what Dotty is doing. Over Christmas, the truth about Dotty and her Uncle Tom’s (Brian Conley) scheme was finally revealed. Sitting down to Christmas dinner, Rocky enjoyed himself which left Dotty fuming. Exposing their secrets, Dotty was thrown out of the house by an angry Sonia (Natalie Cassidy). Coming up, Vinny is forced to tell Suki (Balvinder Sopal) that Dotty is staying at the bedsit. Suki tells him that if Dotty doesn’t pay, she’ll be evicted. The next day, Dotty wakes up after a night of sleeping rough in the allotments. She asks Vinny if he can find her a place to stay and then maybe, they could give things a go romantically. Vinny is confused by her offer and reaches out to Karen (Lorraine Stanley) who, not realising he’s talking about Dotty, advises him to go for it. Later on, Vinny offers to pay for Dotty’s bedsit and asks her out for dinner. Oh, Vinny. This can only end badly, right?
