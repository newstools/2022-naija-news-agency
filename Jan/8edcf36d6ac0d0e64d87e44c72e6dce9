 As families relieve the devastation of losing both relatives and homes, Yahaya said he was made to watch as the gunmen killed his children one after the other. Yahaya, who spoke to The Nation through an interpreter, said that they had all left home for the farm on that Tuesday without an inkling of the danger ahead. He said it was the harvesting period, so they had gone to the farm to harvest their farm produce only for the gunmen to come to them and ask whether they knew where the vigilance men who had operated in the area were staying, but his family told the gunmen that they did not see anyone. He said: “We did not know their exact mission because when they asked us where the vigilantes that operated in the area stayed, we answered them honestly. “If we knew what they were on the farm for, we would have taken to our heels when they arrived. “At least that was what we had been doing to keep safe these past years.” Yahaya said that he was on the farm with six of his children and four others who came to assist them in harvesting, adding that he was the only one spared among them. He said that the gunmen tied his hands and made him watch as his children were being killed without any mercy.
