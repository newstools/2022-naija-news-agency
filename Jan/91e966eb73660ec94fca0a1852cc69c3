The campaign was launched by the Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the APC under the association called “Marafiya Amana” on Sunday in Zamfara State. The chairman of the faction, Sirajo Maikatako, while speaking said they are solidly behind Yari’s political ambition of becoming the national party chairman of the APC. According to Maikatako, the faction of Yari and Marafa in the state are working together to ensure his success in the National Convention of the party. Maikatako said, “I want to bring to the notice of every APC member in the country that Yari has all it takes to be our next national chairman considering his track records both as the Governor of Zamfara State and the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum. “Yari has performed wonderfully well during his tenure both as a Governor and the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum. “So if anybody is against his ambition to contest the chairmanship position of the party, it means that the person is not a true lover of the country.” This article was originally published on Naija News Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
