According to the proscribed pro-Biafra group, the ban on Fulani cows would take effect from April, 2022. IPOB stated that only native cows would be allowed in the region for such events, urging traditional rulers, the clergy and town unions to ensure the message reaches the grassroots. “The ban placed on Fulani cows will take effect in April 2022. “Effective that month, Fulani cows will not be used for any social or ceremonial events and festival in Biafraland. “Our native cows will be used instead for these events. “Traditional custodians of our culture, the clergy and town unions must ensure that this message gets to the grassroots,” the group said.
