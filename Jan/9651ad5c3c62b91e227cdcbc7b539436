A nurse who had been in a coma for 45 days was hours away from having her ventilator being turned off when doctors decided to give her Viagra and she was finally cured in a “Christmas miracle”.  Monica Almeida had taken both her vaccines, yet she tested positive and ended up being rushed to hospital, where she went straight to the resuscitation room, The Sun reported.  The 37-year-old was taken to the ICU and placed in a coma on November 16 with her condition so severe, her parents were told to fly from Portugal to say their final goodbyes.  <img class="img-responsive text-center lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nurse wakes up from 45-day coma after being given Viagra" data-cfstyle="margin: auto;height:225px; width:400px" data-cfsrc="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><img class="img-responsive text-center lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nurse wakes up from 45-day coma after being given Viagra" data-cfstyle="margin: auto;height:225px; width:400px" data-cfsrc="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="img-responsive text-center lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nurse wakes up from 45-day coma after being given Viagra" data-cfstyle="margin: auto;height:225px; width:400px" data-cfsrc="https://i0.wp.com/goldennewsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/932b02a318d949cfe7c0e88f1e274df6.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1">  She was just 72 hours away from having her ventilator turned off when quick-thinking doctors decided to give her a large dose of the drug associated with erectile dysfunction.
