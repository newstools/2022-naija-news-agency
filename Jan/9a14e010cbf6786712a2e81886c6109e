 While Gmail comes preinstalled on a lot of Android devices, it is just the latest on the threshold of google apps that have crossed the 10 billion downloads. First launched in 2004, the email service from Google has enjoyed and also added a lot of features to Gmail lately. Gmail now has exciting features for the web and the Gmail mobile apps that allow users to recall emails within different time frames given its options of varying time periods which ranges from five to ten, twenty or thirty seconds for users to cancel a sent email against the previous standard five-second window to recall a message sent in error. Similarly, Gmail also updated its Google Chat in Gmail to allow users to make one-on-one audio and video calls. While this development is majorly applicable for mobile users on the Android and iOS platforms, these calls can only be made with individual users available in the discussion list with users being able to see missed calls and current call details from the discussion list on Gmail.
