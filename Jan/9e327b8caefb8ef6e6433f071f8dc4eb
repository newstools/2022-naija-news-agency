Web Listening is a highly requested feature by the Clubhouse community and it is the first step towards a desktop experience. The features come on the back of increased downloads of the app as Clubhouse recorded 2.6 million downloads in December 2021, up from 1.8 million in November. Clubhouse is rolling out improvements to the share button, the most significant one being the ability to tap Share on Clubhouse. The Clubhouse community has been asking for more ways to support their favourite creators, clubs, and rooms. Share a room allows users to share a room to their hallway in Clubhouse and notify their followers that they’ve shared a room. Additionally, with this release, Clubhouse is giving creators more tools to understand how their rooms are doing by launching Share and Clip counts at the bottom of the room — and the beginnings of a new Room Insights page. To start, creators will only be able to see the shares of their room, but more insights will be added over time. Share and Clip counts will give creators and the audience more context on how a room is doing and also encourage more sharing and clipping to help drive more people to their favourite rooms, clubs and creators. Both Share and Clip counts together with Room Insights will be available on iOS and Android. Web Listening allows anyone to listen to a Clubhouse room from their phones or laptops, without needing to download an app or log in. To start, it will work for both Replays and live Rooms with Replays enabled. Users will be able to access Replays via any browser and can listen straight from their phone, computer or laptop. If a room is live and Replays are turned on, you can tune into the live Room from the beginning and continue listening on the web. Users will be able to share Replays with their friends and family that don’t have Clubhouse, and they can now listen without being logged in. Creators will also see how many people are listening to their room anonymously from the room itself.
