 A yet-to-be identified gunmen on Sunday shot dead and then beheaded a man said to be a member of the Ebubeagu security operative in Ebonyi State. According to report, the ugly incident happened in Ekpelu, in Ikwo Local Government Area of the state, while the slain man has been identified as Sunday Nwafor, 30. The gunmen, over five of them, were said to have stormed the man’s house at night while he was asleep and shot him dead. They dragged the body out of the room, cut off his head and took it away. The police spokesperson in Ebonyi, Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident. She said two suspects have been arrested over the killing. “According to the wife who spoke to policemen, she said that before she heard a gunshot, she over-heard one of the hoodlums telling her husband that he left them in the bush and came back home to enjoy himself by collecting N30,000 from the government,” the police spokesperson said. “This is barbaric,” she said. Ms Odah said the commissioner of police in the state has ordered an investigation into the incident and has vowed to bring to justice those responsible for it. Gunmen, in a similar manner, earlier this month killed a member of the Ebubeagu in Ebonyi and set ablaze his remains. 9News Nigeria Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
