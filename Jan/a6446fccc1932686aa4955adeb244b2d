 The U.K. government announced Wednesday it’s launching an independent review into the impact the prohibitive rules had on those affected. It’s part of a plan, said minister for veterans Leo Docherty, to “better tailor support to the LGBT veteran community.” “While the modern military embraces the LGBT community, it is important that we learn from the experiences of LGBT veterans who were affected by the pre-2000 ban,” he said in a statement released ahead of the announcement. The government is yet to announce who will chair the review and its terms of reference. The joint chief executives of LGBT armed forces charity Fighting With Pride Craig Jones and Caroline Paige said in their own statement that the inquiry would hear accounts from veterans whose lives were blighted by criminal convictions, prison sentences and dismissal in disgrace before Britain lifted the ban.
