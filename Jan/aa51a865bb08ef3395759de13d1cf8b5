Thomas Tuchel will hold crisis talks with Romelu Lukaku today after the Chelsea boss axed the club’s record-signing for Sunday’s 2 – 2 draw against Liverpool.  Lukaku was completely omitted from the game over his unauthorized interview with Sky Sport Italy in which he confessed to being unhappy at Chelsea.  Tuchel will now have a meeting with his striker during which he will decide whether he is recalled for Wednesday’s Carabao Cup crunch against Tottenham.  When asked about the summit, Tuchel said: ‘First we need to evaluate the situation, not listen to media or pressure, understand what he said and why he said it.  ‘Then we will take the decision if he is good to go for Wednesday.’  Following the game at Stamford Bridge that saw Chelsea share the spoils with Liverpool, former Blues striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was adamant Lukaku needed to find a way back into the side.
