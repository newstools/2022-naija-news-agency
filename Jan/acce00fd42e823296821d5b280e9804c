The reality TV star revealed via Twitter that she has been able to save millions of naira, owns a house and has bought a car. She also spoke on how she was suicidal for a while before things came into focus for her. She wrote: “I don’t acknowledge my progress enough, so today I just want to say that I have done so much for myself at 21. I’ve gotten a house, bought a car, saved millions, cried, laughed, fallen down just to get back up again. I acknowledge myself and acknowledge how far I’ve come. “From being suicidal and not having a clear vision of what I wanted for life to being here? Where everything is getting clearer? Yeah, I’m doing great.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-469164 lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp" alt="" width="300" height="214" data-srcset="https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp 300w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8.webp 535w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-469164 lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp?resize=300%2C214&#038;ssl=1" alt width="300" height="214" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp?resize=300%2C214&#038;ssl=1 300w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8.webp 535w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp?resize=300%2C214&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-469164 lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp?resize=300%2C214&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="214" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8-300x214.webp?resize=300%2C214&#038;ssl=1 300w, https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/61e58cdd83af8.webp 535w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"> In other news, Anita Singh, also known as Nini, has showcased seven cars she acquired before the reality show.
