After introducing a six-person self-driving box and a frickin’ ridable drone concept last year, GM’s latest luxury self-driving EV idea is much more grounded. The InnerSpace concept looks like a futuristic car from the outside—but inside, there’s a two-seat loveseat surrounded by one of the widest screens we’ve ever seen. There’s no steering wheel or pedals, of course. Instead, there’s a built-in ottoman and a compartment for slippers and a blanket. Where GM’s going, you won’t need any sort of manual control.  Even stepping into the car seems like something from science fiction: the doors pop out, while the large windshield/sunroof rises up. As usual, concepts like the InnerSpace are a way for car designers to flex their muscles and imagine what future vehicles could actually be like. While it certainly seems out of reach for most people, perhaps Cadillac’s more affluent clientele would be intrigued by owning a personal spaceship. At least it’s better for the environment than full-sized luxury SUVs. “Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” Bryan Nesbitt, GM’s executive director of Global Advanced Design, said in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time rather than taking it.” As someone who hates the act of driving, but lives in a place where I can’t avoid it, it’ll be interesting to see how car makers turn these self-driving concept vehicles into a reality. And maybe after getting these wild designs through their systems, they’ll show us more concepts for self-driving family EVs. Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on Engadget.
