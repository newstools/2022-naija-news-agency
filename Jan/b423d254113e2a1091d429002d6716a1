Reality star Jess Wright has revealed she is expecting a baby boy. The former Towie favourite, 36, announced she was pregnant in November, sharing the news with a black and white photo as she cradled her baby bump. Her happy news came shortly after she married husband William Lee-Kemp in Majorca, last September. A delighted Jess, who is 21 weeks pregnant, has now confirmed that she is expecting a baby boy, and explained she ‘can’t wait’ to be a mum. Speaking to Hello! magazine, Jess said she had ‘always envisioned being a girl mum because I’m so girly so I was pretty shocked to hear it was a boy,’ but said she ‘couldn’t be happier’ with the news. Husband William said knowing the sex of their unborn baby ‘feels surreal,’ and while he would have been happy with a boy or a girl, ‘having a son as my first child… it doesn’t really get any better’. ‘I can’t wait for weekends for father-son bonding and teaching him to hopefully be a well-mannered, lovely little boy,’ the expectant father said proudly. The newly-married couple had actually discovered they were expecting during their wedding celebrations in September, where they tied the knot surrounded by friends and family. Jess’ brother, fellow Towie star Mark Wright, and his wife Michelle Keegan were among guests at the destination nuptials. ‘It feels like a fairytale,’ Jess shared. ‘We eventually got our wedding and believe it or not, I was unknowingly pregnant at the wedding.’ The reality star fell pregnant naturally after the couple froze their embryos last year, and added that she feels ‘so grateful and blessed’ to be expecting their first child. In her pregnancy announcement at the end of last year, a photograph showed a nude Jess looking down at her stomach with a white sheet protecting her modesty. She wrote in the caption: ‘Beyond grateful for this blessing 🕊👶🏼 Due Spring 2022 🤍.’  Scream slashes box office competition as horror sequel debuts at number one   Kanye West ‘so happy’ as he makes it to daughter Chicago’s birthday party after ban claims   Rylan Clark was admitted to hospital for ‘safety’ after marriage breakdown  The expectant mum, who is best known for appearing on Towie from 2010 to 2016, began dating William in January 2019. She was previously in a relationship with Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice for a few months, before they split in April 2018. Got a story?
