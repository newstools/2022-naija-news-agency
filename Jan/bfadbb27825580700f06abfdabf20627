 National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu says he has informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his presidential ambition. The duo met on Monday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Tinubu, a two-term Lagos governor and former senator, told State House correspondents after the meeting that he had spoken with the president concerning his (Tinubu’s) plans for the future. Tinubu and Buhari forged an alliance that saw the latter defeat the incumbent in 2015 Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The meeting comes less than a week after Buhari declared in an interview aired on Channels TV that he would not disclose his preferred candidate to succeed him for fear of victimisation. The two leaders met on the heels of fresh disagreements among leaders of the ruling party threatening the conduct of the long-awaited national convention. 9News Nigeria Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
