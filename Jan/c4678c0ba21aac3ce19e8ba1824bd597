Borno state governor, Babagana Umara Zulum, has said that members of the terrorist group, Boko Haram, are in control of Abadam and Guzamala Local Government Areas of the state.  The governor disclosed this when Chairman Senate Committee on Army, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume led other senators including military officers from the army headquarters, paid him a courtesy call at the Government House.  ”I am pleased to inform you that we have started witnessing gradual return of peace, but more need to be done, because, presently, Guzamala and Abadam Local Government Areas are still under the control of Boko Haram. Although, the current Service Chiefs, the Theatre Commander, and indeed our General Officer Commanding 7 Division are up and doing.  We want to commend the military and other para military personnel for their gallant efforts to see to the end of terrorism in this part of the country. Unfortunately, Government and people of Borno state, especially those from southern and northern parts of the state are worried over the increasing number of ISWAP groups who have been terrorizing their communities. ISWAP are more equipped, sophisticated, intelligent and dangerous as they grow from strength to strength. ISWAP are collecting taxes along major roads in Damboa and other axis in southern Borno. It is very unfortunate. But the good news is that about 11 local Government areas of Gwoza, Bama, Marte, Monguno, Kaga, Gubio, Mafa, Dikwa, Ngala and host of others are becoming more peaceful than before, and this could be attributed to about 20,000 surrendered members of Boko Haram who are now in our custody. I want to use this opportunity to solicit for prayers from all and sundry for total restoration of peace not only in Borno state, but the country as a whole.” Governor Zulum said Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
