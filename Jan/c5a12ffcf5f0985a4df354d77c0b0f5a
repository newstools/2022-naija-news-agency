An Ado Ekiti High Court on Monday January 17, sentenced Damilola Olasoji, a 36-year-old dismissed soldier and Koiki Benson, 32 to death by hanging for armed robbery.  The court also sentenced Ogbesetuyi Tunde (30) and the two defendants to life imprisonment for offence of conspiracy and attempted robbery.  Olasoji, Benson and Ogbesetuyi Tunde were accused of conspiring and robbing one Mr Oluwadare Adebayo of N1.2million at a Filling Station in Odo-Ado, Ado Ekiti. Adeboye who testified in court, said the robbers stole the money from him after visiting his fuel station while pretending to be customers.  He said;  ”They forced their way into the station’s bulk room and slapped me around, hitting me from time to time with the gun butt.”  Justice Lekan Ogunmoye who delivered judgement on the case, held that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubts the elements of offence of conspiracy, attempted robbery and armed robbery against the convicts.  Ogunmoye said;  “In all, the sole issue for determination is resolved in favour of the prosecution. In count two case of armed robbery, Olasoji and Benson are hereby sentenced to death by hanging. May God almighty have mercy upon your souls.” Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
