According to Starrfm.com.gh, the attacker struck the deceased who is yet to be identified with an object in the head and then stabbed her in the abdomen. The news website reports sources at Aposs-Okanta Prayer Center as saying a mentally unstable inmate at the prayer centre, now at large, is suspected to have committed the crime. The woman reportedly met her untimely death in the house of one Elder Tetteh who is at the centre, the report said.
