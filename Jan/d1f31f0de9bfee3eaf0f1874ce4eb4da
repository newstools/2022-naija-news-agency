In a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, it’s Secretary-General, Ohanaeze warned that such moves by these politicians will sink the country. The group berated those working against the gentleman pact of the rotational presidency between the North and South in 2023. They urged the north to voluntarily hand over power to the south for the interest of peace and stability, “except if they have decided to set the nation ablaze and sink it.” Ohanaeze stated that owners of Nigeria craftily designed policies and procedures to enslave Igbos politically and economically, stressing that this is pushing the people of the Southeast out of Nigeria. According to the group, only 2023 Igbo Presidency will assuage the perceptions that Igbo are still part of Nigeria. Ohanaeze said: “Atiku shouldn’t have sent his foot-soldiers to come up with tales by moonlight, as it is arrogant, absurd and disrespectful to come to the southeast and look at us in our faces and vomit fallacies that north’s tenure has not expired. “We wish to categorically state that it is Igbo’s turn to succeed President Buhari in 2023 and Atiku should reciprocate the support Igbos gave him in 2019 and support one of his most trusted Igbo allies for 2023. “Endeavors to bring another Northerner as President in 2023 will be a disaster and it will sink Nigeria, many Southern ethnic groups will join Igbo to walk away from Nigeria as ethnic domineering and intimidation will end up the union. “Atiku had refused to learn from history, as he’s the best President Nigeria will never have, as age and competence is the new watchword and order, to determine who will be President in 2023, and now age is not on the side of Atiku, he should end the ill-fated journey to Aso Rock and support Ndigbo.” This article was originally published on Naija News Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
