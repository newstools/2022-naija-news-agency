Chelsea are targeting Stuttgart’s Borna Sosa to provide cover on Thomas Tuchel’s left flank, according to reports in Germany. Ben Chilwell’s season-ending injury has left Tuchel short of options and the Champions league holders have been looking to find cover before the transfer window closes. Chelsea had explored the possibility of signing Lucas Digne but he sealed his move from Everton to Aston Villa last week. The Blues have also held talks with Lyon in an attempt to recall Emerson Palmieri, but the French club have refused an offer of £3 million. According to Sky Germany, Chelsea have now cast their net even wider and are weighing up a move for Sosa, as he is capable of playing in multiple roles on the left flank. The report claims that Aston Villa had also targeted the Stuttgart left-back before they sealed their move for Digne. Sky Germany claim that Stuttgart are holding out for a €30 million (£25.1m) transfer fee for the Croatia international, which could put Chelsea off making a move this month. Stuttgart are also reluctant to let Sosa leave as he is a key part of their team and they are currently in a relegation battle in the Bundesliga.

But we will check out options.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news onFacebook, Twitter and Instagram.
