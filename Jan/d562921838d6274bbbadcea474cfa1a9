Emmerdale villain Meena Jutla (Paige Sandhu) will be back to cause chaos at Dawn Taylor (Olivia Bromley) and Billy Fletcher’s (Jay Kontzle) after they made the mistake of posting details on social media – and fans cannot wait. Meena was last seen on-screens earlier this month, after holding Manpreet (Rebecca Sarker) and Vinny (Bradley Johnson) hostage. When Liam (Jonny McPherson) saved the day and pulled Vinny and Manpreet to safety, he discovered the truth about Meena – including the fact she murdered his daughter Leanna. However, with the serial killer currently on the run, it won’t be long before she’s back for more chaos in the village. Thursday night’s episode saw Meena decide to return after finding out details of Dawn and Billy’s Valentine’s Day wedding. After drafting in Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) to help put on the last-minute ceremony, she urged them to post the update on social media. ‘First thing you need to do is let all your guests… get on your socials and post the wedding,’ she told them. But despite reluctance from Dawn, Leyla reminded her: ‘Big or small, you want them to know, don’t you?’ Little did they know Meena would be able to see all the details for herself as she was seen right at the end of the episode plotting her return. She discovered Dawn had uploaded a ‘Save the Date’ post to social media, telling truck driver Tommy her ‘change of plans.’ ‘Can’t believe they’re getting married on Valentine’s Day, Valentine’s day how trashy is that? Tommy asked whether she was ready to hit the road, but Meena confirmed her return to the Dales, telling him: ‘I just found out a friend’s getting married. I have to go back, I can’t miss the big day…’ Fans were buzzing to see the return of the iconic character, expecting murderous chaos on the horizon. #Emmerdale Meena’s back no it won’t be a valentines massacre — chantalmascoe (@ChantalMascoe) January 27, 2022 WTH is mad Meena gonna do #emmerdale — â¤ï¸â¤ï¸FIONAâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸ (@sadlerfiona21) January 27, 2022 Valentines day massacre Meena coming back ðð #Emmerdale — Kwamz ð¬ð­ð¬ð§ (@k_heyrab) January 27, 2022 OMG when did queen Meena come back? #Meenadale #Emmerdale — Danny 3.0 (@DannyLew89) January 27, 2022 One wrote on Twitter: ‘Oooh Meena .. cannot wait what she’s got in store lol #emmerdale, with another predicting: ‘A not so happy St Valentine’s Day wedding coming in #Emmerdale then?? #Meena.’ ‘Yay Meena! #emmerdale @emmerdale bring on St Valentine, Who will be next for the chop!’ added a fan.
