The MultiChoice South Africa Bursary Scheme aims to help approximately 200 students. For the 2022 bursary scheme, ten of these students will be funded via the Nomzamo Lighthouse Foundation – an organisation that invests in the future of South African youth – of which MultiChoice is a partner. The bursaries extend beyond tuition fees and include registration fees, accommodation costs, and an annual living allowance. The MultiChoice Bursary Scheme is open to students in all years of study, including students who have enrolled for their first post-graduate degree that is focused on the STEM discipline (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), particularly: “As technological developments continue to advance at a rapid pace, there is a critical need for a dynamic workforce in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in order for our country to keep up with the rest of the world,” said Nyiko Shiburi, CEO of MultiChoice South Africa. “We see the value in opening doors for youth to build the skills within our industry, shaping the professionals who will lead us into the future.” Eligibility To be eligible to apply, applicants must meet the following criteria: An external bursary management entity (Skills 123) has been procured to support with facilitation of the bursary administration. This bursary management provider has partnered with youth marketing specialists, Student Village, who have a wide reach across different campuses countrywide.
