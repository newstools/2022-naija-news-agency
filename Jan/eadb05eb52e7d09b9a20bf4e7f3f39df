From 2005 to 2014, Saget would also frequently be heard, but not seen in the popular American comedy series How I Met Your Mother.  He acted in the series as the voice-over of main character Ted Mosby.  In 2016, Netflix launched a spin-off of the Full House series, titled Fuller House.  In it, Saget again took on the role of Danny Tanner.  That show ended in 2020. Security guards at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Orlando, where Saget was staying, found him dead in his hotel room on Sunday.  In September 2021, Saget had started a new tour.  He planned to tour the United States through May with his stand-up comedy show.  On Saturday he gave another performance in Jacksonville, Florida.  Hours before his death, he wrote on Twitter how much he enjoyed playing that show. How and from what he died is still unclear.  The Orange County police in Florida has announced via Twitter that there does not appear to be a crime and that no drugs have been involved.  Saget was married and had three children.
