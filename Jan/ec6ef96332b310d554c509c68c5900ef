The Masked Singer fans and Michelle Keegan’s mum believe the star is behind the Firework costume – but she’s insisted performing on the show would be her ‘worst nightmare’. On Saturday’s episode of The John Bishop Show, the former soap star laughed at the thought of her being one of the characters on this year’s wacky show, however, she didn’t deny anything. This year’s mystery celebs have largely left the panel of judges – Rita Ora, Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall, and Mo Gilligan – stumped. ‘You know I could be bluffing you all here and I don’t want to ruin it, but I cannot sing,’ she told the host and guest star Bill Bailey. ‘I’m not a singer so for me that’s my worst nightmare.’ Although the Brassic actress is dismissing the claims, certain fans are trusting their gut. One person tweeted: ‘I think Mo is right, firework is Michelle Keegan. Her voice started to go deeper when she started talking again, she’s known for her style.’ @MaskedSingerUK Iâm sticking my neck on the line and going with Anthony Hopkins as traffic cone ð ð´ó §ó ¢ó ·ó ¬ó ³ó ¿ #silentlambs #gobigorgohome Jane mcdonald as mushroom, Michelle keegan as firework #MaskedSingerUK — melissa johnson (@Meliemel77) January 15, 2022 I think Mo is right, firework is Michelle Keegan.

I am 1000% invested in @MaskedSingerUK Firework – Michelle KeeganMushroom – Jane HorrocksRobo Bunny – Mark off WestlifeDoughnuts – Michael Owen — runwildalice (@runwildalice) January 12, 2022 Firework is Michelle Keegan she beat 900 other applicants for the corrie part #MaskedSinger — colin evans (@colinev45538453) January 8, 2022 While another added: ‘I’m sticking my neck on the line and going with Anthony Hopkins as traffic cone #silentlambs#gobigorgohome Jane McDonald as mushroom, Michelle Keegan as firework.’ During Firework’s second appearance, Mo reiterated his view that it could be Michelle, due to the reference to the singer finding love on a TV show, with the comedian thinking that could have been about a soap. Other guesses for Firework include Mel C, Jodie Kidd, Melanie Sykes and Sinitta. During their second appearance, Firework offered two lies and a truth, and one of them was, ‘you couldn’t make up how I beat 900 people,’ with fans believing Michelle beat out 900 applicants for Coronation Street. In the recent episode of The Masked Singer, Bagpipes was unmasked as tennis star Pat Cash, which made him the fourth celebrity eliminated. Pat said: ‘I’ve always been a frustrated rock star and fancied doing the Masked Singer from the first day I saw it.

It was a great experience overall. As luck would have it, my schedule cleared. I’m a big believer in letting your higher power take over and I suppose it meant I was able to take part in the show.’ The Masked Singer returns Saturday at 7pm on ITV Got a story?
