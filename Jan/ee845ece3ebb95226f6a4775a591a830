Jenny Connor (Sally Ann Matthews) has had a lot of hang ups over her blossoming romance with younger man Leo in Coronation Street. They have been dating for a while, but Jenny remains uncomfortable over the age difference, thinking that she is making a fool of herself or Leo has ulterior motives. Promising a comedy story with heart, Iain MacLeod told us that amid Jenny’s struggle, there will be a genuine hope. The producer explained: ‘I love that story – when an older man goes for a younger woman no-one blinks an eye but when it’s the other way round it’s the story – we want to address that it shouldn’t be remarkable, genuine emotional, what’s wrong with that? ‘Jenny asks if she is a cougar, does he have a fetish for older women– it’s played like a rom com. There’s incredibly funny bits in it but mega cringe at some scenes. It’s funny, romantic, long running – Jenny’s prejudices and self consciousness of her age and age gap relationships confront her. ‘But she pursues her own happiness but it’s not straight forward. The Rovers has been one of the biggest challenges, I am itching to chuck fifteen people in there as soon as I ncan. As joyous as it should be, we finally have a group that bring fun and chemistry. ‘Emma, Gemma, Sean, Jenny, Daisy – it’s a brilliant group. We want the Rovers back to what it should be. The Jenny story is brilliant fun – we need some fun after the last few years. It feels fresh and it feels very fresh.’ If you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.
