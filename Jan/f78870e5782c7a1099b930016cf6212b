The band from The Hague receives the prize because, according to the jury, they are still relevant after more than twenty years.  The band is also known for thinking about possibilities instead of problems.  For example, DI-RECT was one of the first, but certainly the most prominent band in the Netherlands to discover the possibilities of streaming concerts during the pandemic. The award ceremony had already happened before.  The band was robbed in their own studio with the Popprijs.  Guitarist Spike van Zoest responded: ,,After the last Popprijs was awarded, I thought we weren’t ready yet.  But we are two years later and now we get this.”  Laughing: ,,I only want to play in front of an audience in that big hall now!” Under normal circumstances, DI-RECT would not be revealed as the winner until late on Saturday evening on the largest stage of Noorderslag.  Traditionally, a beer shower and a performance followed for years.  Now only a streamed concert followed. The Popprijs was not awarded last year, because a festive presentation was not considered appropriate after all the damage the corona crisis had caused to the music industry.  Singer Meau also received a prize on Saturday, she received the Kickstart Award for up-and-coming talent on behalf of radio station 3FM.  Last year it went to Froukje, who also performed this year.  The other artists who provided a fifteen-minute stream concert on Saturday evening included Son Mieux, Wies and S10, who will represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest.
