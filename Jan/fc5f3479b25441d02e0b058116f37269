The campaign posters of the Peoples Democratic Party chieftain were sighted on Monday at some traffic kiosks along airport road, Asokoro and the Federal Secretariat. The posters had the inscription, “Here to serve 2023: Barr Ezenwo Nyesom Wike for president.” Wike’s presidential campaign posters were sponsored by “Northerners For Change Group”. The Rivers State Governor, however, is yet to declare his intentions to contest for the presidency in 2023.
