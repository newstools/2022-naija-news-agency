The girl will be in government custody and she needs to go back to school. Her dream is to be a musician and we will encourage her,” Ogbise said. Also speaking, Mrs Pekeowei, urged residents of the state to be vigilant and alert the GRIT and other gender advocacy groups in the state of any case of girl child violation or molestation in any form. “Members of the public should always speak up and reach out to relevant authorities,” Pekeowei said.
