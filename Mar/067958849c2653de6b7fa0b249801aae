A children’s hospital in Ukraine’s Mariupol has been completely destroyed by Russian bombing, according to the city council. ‘The Russian occupying forces have dropped several bombs on the children’s hospital. The destruction is colossal,’ authorities said. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. The southern port city is surrounded by Putin’s troops and has been the site of heavy bombardment for days. This has left thousands of people without food, water and electricity. The Red Cross has described the situation as ‘apocalyptic’.  Several attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol have failed in recent days. There is no evidence anybody was able to leave during an agreed ceasefire today. Mariupol’s deputy mayor claims 1,200 people have been killed in the city in the two weeks since the Russian invasion.
