Mikel Arteta praised the attitude of injured Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale who demonstrated the togetherness in the current squad by celebrating Saturday’s 1-0 win over Aston Villa with his understudy Bernd Leno. The Germany international lost his status as the club’s undisputed No.1 three games into the new campaign having conceded nine goals in defeats against Brentford, Chelsea and Manchester City. Summer signing Ramsdale has hardly put a foot wrong since coming into the team but Leno was restored to the starting line-up on Saturday with the former Sheffield United goalkeeper having sustained an injury in Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat against Liverpool. Leno produced a competent display and made a crucial injury-time save from Philippe Coutinho’s free-kick to secure the three points which helped Arsenal tighten their grip on fourth place.

He wanted to be here to support Bernd which tells you about a lot of things behind the scenes. ‘It’s been tough for Bernd [Leno], not playing the minutes he’s been used to in his career, but Aaron [Ramsdale] was there to support him. ‘Emile [Smith Rowe] has had some issues in the last few weeks and came in for 90 minutes because he’s managed to look after himself well.’  Ray Parlour urges Arsenal to take ‘gamble’ and sign Everton and Brentford stars   Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard praises Arsenal board for Mikel Arteta decision   ‘They missed a trick!’ Joe Cole claims Arsenal made the wrong decision to sack Unai Emery  On the significance of a result which put Arsenal four points clear of Manchester United and six ahead of Spurs, Arteta added: ‘It’s a very big win for us. ‘I thought we played fantastically well, but we didn’t put the game to bed when we had the chances. Then you suffer, but we showed the resilience to win. ‘Villa are a very good team and to come here is always extremely difficult. We managed to do the things we wanted to do in the match and I think we deserved to win the game. ‘The connection between the players and the fans is exceptional and that gives you a lot of energy and belief. There’s still 10 games to go and you can see how small the margins are. The key is that we are there [in the top four] and that we believe we can do it.’ MORE : Mikel Arteta sends message to Bernd Leno after rare start in Arsenal’s win over Aston Villa MORE : Martin Keown sends Spurs top four warning to Arsenal after Aston Villa win For more stories like this, check our sport page.
