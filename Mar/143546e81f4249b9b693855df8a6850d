OnePipe has remained committed to providing embedded finance to Nigerian businesses and has since gone on to partner with about seven financial institutions in Nigeria, and has also made it possible for non-financial institutions like Omnibiz, Grow trade and Winich Farms to launch and cross-sell a range of financial services like credits, accounts and payments within their offerings.
