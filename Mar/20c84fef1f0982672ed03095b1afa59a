 The Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has charged party members to brace up for the task of building the party in Abia State, urging members to be committed and united ahead of the general elections. Kalu gave the charge when he hosted Abia State Students from Ahmadu Bello University Zaria at his Abuja residence. According to the former Governor of Abia State, “Some of our members are not committed to the growth of the party in Abia state. Some of them are PDP members at night and APC at day. “They visit the Government House at night to reaffirm their allegiance to the PDP even as members of the APC. It has stop! “It is not possible to serve two masters at the same time. It is either you are in PDP or APC. It is time to show commitment and stop selling out the APC to others.” He further congratulated the newly elected National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Kalu urged all members of the NWC to work towards unity and harmony to help the party succeed in the 2023 general election. He described the party’s National Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, as competent and well-experienced, expressed confidence in the new executive members. He urged the executives to swing into action by uniting party members ahead of the general election. He said: “I want to charge the national chairman to urgently commence the process of getting all members united and committed ahead of the 2023 general elections. “I want to congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari, newly elected members of the NWC, and other members of the party for the success recorded in the national convention. “I am appealing to Nigerians to continue to entrust the affairs of the country to the All Progressives Congress (APC). APC is a party for all Nigerians. APC is committed to the growth, unity and development of Nigeria.” 9News Nigeria Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
