 The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reports that 60 Nigerians evacuated from Ukraine have tested positive for COVID-19. The NCDC’s data revealed that 24 hours after making known the lowest daily figure ever recorded since the outbreak in 2020, two cases. Just a day after, it recorded 118 new infections. The statistics show that the Nigerian returnees from Ukraine contributed to the surge, as they accounted for a total of 60 out of the whole amount. 772 evacuees returned to Nigeria on March 4, 2022, through Max Air and Air Peace, following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24. Since the invasion, there have been reported casualties from both countries, leading many residents of Ukraine, including Nigerians, to flee to neighbouring countries. The Nigerian government had approved the release of $8.5 million for the prompt evacuation of at least 5,000 Nigerians fleeing the Russian-Ukrainian conflict zone to Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia.
