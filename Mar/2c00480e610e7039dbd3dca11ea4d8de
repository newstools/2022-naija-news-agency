The first was the Postal Reform Act passed by the Senate on March 8th in a bipartisan vote that showed both sides of the government can still work together, which is a rarity in today’s political climate. The following day, the White House released the exhilarating Executive Order which Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. Perhaps the word “exhilarating” is relative and maybe a stretch, but the Executive Order is truly exciting news for our country. Although the two are seemingly unrelated, both actions are crucial in expanding financial inclusion and access for the American people. Commenting on the America’s moves in the race for financial innovation, Briana Marbury, the Executive Director, Interledger Foundation, recalled that the Postal Reform Act has been 15 years in the making and is a breath of fresh air for the debt-ridden service. “Negating the fact Postmaster General Louis Dejoy has made many eyebrow-raising decisions since taking office in 2020, the 10-year, $107 billion proposal will go a long way in alleviating the post office’s crippling financial obligations and updating its outdated infrastructure. “Despite years of being the whipping post for Republican criticism of government waste, the USPS has continuously received high marks for trust and approval from the public – and rightfully so. “During the early days of the pandemic, postal workers transformed into everyday heroes and continued to ensure essential and critical items were delivered, even as the world battled the deadly virus, COVID. “Then, in a move that would deepen its service offerings to the community, the USPS launched a postal-banking pilot program in 2021 in 4 locations to provide financial services in areas lacking access. “One day after the Postal Reform Act was passed, the Biden administration signed an Executive Order that put into words what many have been expressing and/or thinking for some time now: the American financial system is falling behind the times and desperately needs to evolve to keep up with the rest of the world”. Many countries, including Nigeria, have been exploring and implementing ways to expand financial access as it’s been proven the current financial systems and infrastructure often leaves vulnerable communities behind. Continuining, Marbury said “Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and Digital Assets assist in closing this gap.  Until it was formally stated by President Biden, the United States has been reluctant to jump on the innovation train and pondered on the subject of innovation instead of moving forward in a meaningful way.  While we sat at the station and contemplated buying a ticket, the Bahamas introduced their own CBDC, the Sand Dollar, and China casually rolled out the Digital Yuan at this year’s Winter Olympic games. “The two steps taken last week will help put us back on track.  By making a commitment to improve the United States Postal Service which includes the potential for expansion of public banking, along with a pledge to drive digital asset innovation forward in the most affirmative language to date, we’re staking our claim to remain at the forefront of the rapidly evolving financial sector.  Leadership in an interconnected and complex global economy requires a robust and forward-thinking approach from both the public and private sectors, and yes, it is exhilarating to see it in action.
