This is the chilling moment injured Russian soldiers in wheelchairs – some missing entire limbs – are awarded medals for their ‘bravery’ in Ukraine. Kremlin-controlled state television released the footage of ‘special operation’ veterans looking shell-shocked at a hospital in Moscow. Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin hailed their war efforts as he pinned medals on their stripy pyjamas, all while the men sat in silence. They each shook hands with the government official, followed by a quick, forced clap. ‘You all carried out the orders assigned to you, you all gave one hundred percent,’ Mr Fomin told them. ‘Like real men, like real soldiers, you continued the glorious military traditions of our grandfathers and fathers.’ In a separate video, another Russian minister is seen giving a medal to a bedbound soldier, who lost a leg fighting in Ukraine. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T1M2S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/28/10/55899295-0-image-a-16_1648461034609.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-03-28T10:44:06+0100","description":"Russian defence ministry released footage of wounded Russian soldiers receiving medals in a military hospital in Moscow.nnDeputy defence minister Alexander Fomin awarded the soldiers with two medals for 'Valour' and six 'Orders of Courage,' the ministry said in a note accompanying the footage release.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/03/28/2499754743363907838/480x270_MP4_2499754743363907838.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

The footage is in complete contrast to the ones shared by Volodymyr Zelensky’s office, showing wounded troops and civilians tearing up when the President visited their bedside. It comes after reports of plummeting morale among the Russian army on the frontline as their leaders grow frustrated with the lack of progress. Since the invasion began on February 24, some soldiers even claimed they were unaware they were heading to a real battle. Instead, they thought they were going on a training exercise.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, the country has suffered widespread damages and loss of life amid a major bombing campaign. Millions of people have fled the country, with thousands of British people opening up their homes to Ukrainian refugees. Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t shown any signs of calling off the attack anytime soon, with his spokesperson claiming that he is refusing to rule out using nuclear weapons.
