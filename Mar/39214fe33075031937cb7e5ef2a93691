 Bello who arrived at about 12pm went straight to the National Working Committee NWC Hall. He also parked his official vehicle at the designated parking lot of the “National Chairman”.  He was soon followed by the National Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe who came into the secretariat at about 12:07 pm. Sources at the meeting said at least nine of the 12 CECPC members were present and that the session was being presided over by Gov. Bello. This move may be a confirmation of an earlier report that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the sack of Gov. Mai Mala Buni as National Chairman of the CECPC, and replaced him with Governor Bello. This is despite the fact that armed security men took over the national headquarters of the party in Abuja.No less than 15 patrol vehicles of security operatives cordoned off access roads to the party secretariat as early as 9 am. Over 70 armed operatives barricaded all the Blantyre Street, stopping all human and vehicular movements into the Secretariat. Gov. Buni who travelled outside the country last week was being expected back to the country on Monday but as of the time of filing this report, it was not immediately clear if he was back as most of his aides were not seen at the secretariat.
