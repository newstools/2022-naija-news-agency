On Thursday, the gospel singer turned to social media to introduce his fans to his “Still Waters,” who goes by the Instagram handle @ericakatrina. He posted some beautiful candid photos of the gorgeous couple wearing matching jeans and beige coats—possibly a pre-wedding photo. “Just take a look at the person I get to do Lifeeee with!!! @ericakatrina_,” he wrote. “You’re My greatest reward from God!
