 Salvini, head of Italy’s League party, was in Przemyśl on the border with Ukraine when the mayor, Wojciech Bakun, held up a T-shirt emblazoned with Putin’s face and the words “Army of Russia” during a press conference, videos posted on social media showed. Salvini wore a similar shirt during a visit to Red Square in 2014, when he was a member of the European Parliament. He also wore a similar shirt a year later in the Parliament in Strasbourg, posing for a photograph and writing (in a now-deleted post) on Facebook that he would “swap” two of Italian President Sergio Mattarella for “half” a Putin. Standing next to a visibly uncomfortable Salvini, Bakun said: “Look at what the person you call a friend did to the people who come across the border in numbers of 50,000 a day.” He then said they could go visit a refugee center if Salvini wore the same T-shirt that he sported in Red Square. Salvini interrupted Bakun, saying: “We are helping refugees, children, moms, dads, from Ukraine.” The Italian then walked away. Salvini has long declared his admiration for the Russian president. In 2017, he signed a cooperation agreement with Putin’s United Russia party, while League officials were probed for allegations that they sought to sign a secretive oil deal with the Kremlin in 2018 worth millions of euros. (Salvini denied any wrongdoing.) But the far-right leader has sung a different tune since Putin invaded Ukraine, taking to Twitter to “condemn any military aggression” and calling for a “common response from allies,” before posting a video of him bringing flowers to the Ukrainian embassy in Rome. Bad adventure for Matteo Salvini at the Ukrainian-Polish border: the mayor of Przemys refused to go with him and showed the shirt worn by the leader of the League in the European Parliament a few years ago: “No respect for you” (<img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3a5.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="🎥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1"> @SimoneAlliva) pic.twitter.com/rniXmeadBO — Marco Bresolin (@marcobreso) March 8, 2022  Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
