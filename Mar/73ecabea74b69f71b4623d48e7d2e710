 Digne joined Villa in a £25 million deal in January. Indeed, he was one of a few statement signings that Gerrard made in his first transfer window at Villa Park. Digne had been in a tough situation at Everton this season. While he had been a mainstay of the side the three seasons prior, his game time suffered this term. There were reports of a rift between the Frenchman and then Toffees manager Rafa Benitez. Digne had started 13 league games, but was omitted from squads following those reports. Gerrard swooped at the opportunity to land the left-back. Indeed, he has played eight games in an Aston Villa shirt to this point and registered an assist against his former club on his second appearance. Digne appears to be relishing his time at Villa, and recently hailed the club in an interview with L’Equipe. “It’s just fabulous. The infrastructure, the staff of around thirty people, the personalised video rooms, the nutritionists there every day, the five physical trainers… Everything is done to make you feel good, to progress,” he said. “At first, it was hard to remember all the first names. I had a list of numbers… Fortunately, with WhatsApp, there are photos.” It seems that Digne is in awe at the facilities available to him at Villa. What’s more, it sounds as if he has adjusted well following the January move. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2069789" src="https://i0.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/03/21140505/steven.gerrard.aston_.villa_.march_.2022-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C608&#038;ssl=1" alt="Steven Gerrard, Aston Villa, March 2022." width="1080" height="608" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/03/21140505/steven.gerrard.aston_.villa_.march_.2022-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C608&#038;ssl=1 1600w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/03/21140505/steven.gerrard.aston_.villa_.march_.2022-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/03/21140505/steven.gerrard.aston_.villa_.march_.2022-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/03/21140505/steven.gerrard.aston_.villa_.march_.2022-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/03/21140505/steven.gerrard.aston_.villa_.march_.2022-1-231x130.jpg 231w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Gerrard’s impact has clearly been a big factor in Villa’s recruitment since he took charge at the club. His ambition is clear to see, and that appears to be something that has rubbed off on the players. What’s more, Digne went on to hail Gerrard for his actions immediately after his arrival was confirmed. “[Gerrard is a] great legend and great man,” continued Digne. “As soon as I talked to him, I knew I wanted to go there. “I had an incredible welcome from the coach, from the players. When I signed, around 9pm, Gerrard was there to give me a hug, to tell me that he was happy that I joined Villa. “We talked for two hours. He didn’t have to, he could have waited for training the next day.” That welcome would have helped ease the star into his new club. Furthermore, Digne was welcomed by members of the playing squad too. “I also received a message from captain Tyrone Mings. Morgan Sanson, a great guy, they welcomed me with open arms. Thanks to him, my integration was dazzling and I can only thank him,” he added. Clearly, there is a good atmosphere at Villa, and that is reflected in their performances.
