The US Supreme Court on Friday voted to reimpose the death sentence for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, reversing the decision of a federal appeals court that had tossed the deadly punishment in 2020. The court’s 6-3 decision found that the lower court was wrong when it threw out Tsarnaev’s death sentence in 2020. The ruling had been voided over issues with jury selection and evidence of a separate crime Tasarnaev committed two years before the bombing that was excluded during his trial. Tsarnaev was convicted of joining his older brother, Tamerlan, in planting and detonating two pressure cooker bombs at separate spots near the Boston marathon finish line in 2013. The explosions killed three people and left hundreds of others with grave injuries. The Biden Administration had asked the Supreme Court to restore Tsarnaev’s death sentences, even though President Joe Biden opposes the death penalty and the Justice Department reinstated a moratorium on federal executions in July, NBC News reported.
