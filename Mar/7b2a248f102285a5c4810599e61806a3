Thomas Tuchel says Real Madrid will present a ‘big challenge’ after his Chelsea team were drawn to face the Spanish club in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Chelsea avoided Premier League rivals Liverpool and Manchester City in Friday’s draw but may feel slightly apprehensive after being pitted against 13-time winners Real Madrid. Madrid are currently ten points clear in La Liga and stunned Paris Saint-Germain in the previous round thanks to Karim Benzema’s stunning second-half hat-trick. Chelsea, though, have enjoyed an impressive European campaign thus far and beat Real Madrid in the semi-finals of last season’s Champions League on their way to lifting the trophy. Reacting to the draw, Tuchel said on Friday: ‘Tough one. The challenge can not be much higher than playing a second leg in the Bernabeu with spectators. ‘It’s a big challenge but there is big excitement around this match and around this fixture. We know what’s coming. It will be an exciting match and a tough challenge. ‘It’s nice to play a European team and maybe not at this kind of stage a team you’ve played so many times in domestic competitions.’ More to follow… Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
