Unlike free-to-play games where players buy digital items with no inherent value, MetalCore’s in-game economy will allow players to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. “Our team has extensive game development experience across premium and free-to-play games,” said Matt Candler, President of Studio 369, Inc. “We are gamers ourselves and will deliver fun and rewarding gameplay in this new business model that integrates NFT’s with proven game mechanics.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69676" src="https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MetalCore-completes-15-million-private-token-and-NFT-sale-3.png?resize=740,390&amp;ssl=1" alt="MetalCore completes $15 million private token and NFT sale " width="740" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MetalCore-completes-15-million-private-token-and-NFT-sale-3.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MetalCore-completes-15-million-private-token-and-NFT-sale-3.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/techeconomy.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MetalCore-completes-15-million-private-token-and-NFT-sale-3.png?resize=768%2C404&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> “From our experience in identifying trends and opportunities in the gaming industry, we have seen first-hand how carefully integrated NFT mechanics can create compelling new experiences.
