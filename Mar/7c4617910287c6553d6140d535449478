Former governor of Anambra state and current Minister of Labour and productivity, Senator Chris Nwabueze Ngige has stated he would make his decision  on his intention to run for the office of the president of Nigeria known in April.

He further explained that he is eminently qualified to be the President of Nigeria, stressing that section 131 of the Nigerian constitution remains clear on who should run for the exalted office.
