The Nigerian men converged at the premises of the Embassy of Ukraine in Nigeria in Abuja on Thursday to express their readiness to join the Ukrainian side.
However, the Embassy of Ukraine in Nigeria says Nigerians who are willing to travel to Ukraine to f!ght Russian forces must be willing to provide $1,000 for ticket and visa. “The $1,000 requirement is too high,” said Monday Adikwu, with number 96NA/41/2808, who was dismissed from the Nigerian Army for leaving his duty post to visit his pregnant wife without permission. He said: “I want to go to Ukraine because I am a military man. I fought in Liberia. I fought in Sierra Leone. I was part of the 33 Battalion. I was trained by Ukrainian soldiers when I was in the United Nations in Kosovo on how to shoot and drive APC tanks. I can drive it very well.
.
So, when I heard about Ukraine and the way people are trooping in… I am a farmer. I don’t have anything. I am a f!ghter. They said they will pay us so I am ready to f!ght so that I can get paid and take care of my family. I will also bring glory to the name of Nigeria as a worthy ambassador.” Adikwu, who was accompanied by other dismissed soldiers, said they were not afraid of Russian forces. “We are not scared. It was David that k!lled Goliath with only a tool. So, I believe my going to Ukraine will give them victory.” Meanwhile, the Second Secretary at the Ukrainian Embassy to Nigeria, Bohdan Soltys, said it would be difficult for Nigerians to travel to Ukraine now since the airspace had been shut due to the w@r. He said since Nigerians needed visas to visit Romania and Poland, it would be difficult for them to use the land borders.
The diplomat said Ukraine was not recruiting mercenaries but volunteers. He, therefore, advised Nigerians not to focus on the money. On why $1,000 was being demanded from Nigerian volunteers, the Ukrainian diplomat said, “Yes, $1,000. That is what I paid the last time I visited Ukraine.” Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
