The Academy has issued a statement saying it ‘does not condone violence’ after Will Smith hit Chris Rock following a joke he made about his wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, at the Oscars 2022. Shortly before King Richard star Will won the best actor award, he stormed up on  stage after hearing the joke from Chris. He hit the comedian, before telling him: ‘Keep my wife’s name out of your f**king mouth.’ The Academy tweeted a statement reading: ‘The Academy does not condone violence of any form. ‘Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world.’ Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Police Department have said a report has not been filed. A spokesperson told PA: ‘LAPD investigative entities are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards programme. The Academy does not condone violence of any form. Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world. — The Academy (@TheAcademy) March 28, 2022 ‘The incident involved one individual slapping another.
