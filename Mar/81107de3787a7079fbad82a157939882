Manchester United have interviewed Mauricio Pochettino over the club’s managerial vacancy, following talks with Ajax boss Erik ten Hag last week. The Argentine is a long-term interest for the Red Devils and the club have twice tried to appoint him in the past, only to favour Jose Mourinho in 2016 and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018. Pochettino is keen on a move to Old Trafford but he’s reluctant to say so on record given his position as Paris Saint-Germain boss. The former Tottenham boss is likely to leave the club no matter what happens this summer but United would have to pay a significant compensation package should the wish to hire him before he is sacked. Nevertheless, after Ten Hag impressed United’s board with his vision for the club last week, Santi Aouna claims Pochettino has now had his interview with United’s board. The possibility of Pochettino becoming United’s manager is described as being ‘more real than ever’, after the Argentine laid out his vision and plans for the club in the short and long-term. United told Pochettino that they intend on interviewing other candidates and that a decision would not be made imminently. The club do hope to make an appointment by the end of the season, in time for the summer transfer window.
