The Apprentice comes to a close tonight, as Lord Alan Sugar will name either Kathryn Burn or Harpreet Kaur the winner of this year’s series. Season 16 has seen the candidates compete in a wide range of challenges, from creating a marketing campaign for a cruise ship to designing their own video game. Now, in the final episode of the season, the two finalists will face their biggest challenge so far: launching their business. But what will the winner of The Apprentice get? The Apprentice final, which will air on BBC One tonight, March 24, will see Kathryn and Harpreet go head to head as they launch their businesses, with the help of the previously fired candidates. After 10 challenges and a gruelling round of interviews, tonight will be their last chance to impress Lord Sugar and win this year’s show. The winner of The Apprentice gets a £250,000 investment in their business, and Lord Sugar will become their business partner. In the early seasons of the show, the winner would win a high-paying job at one of Lord Sugar’s companies. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T32S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/24/10/55743105-0-image-a-46_1648117964217.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-03-24T10:30:45+0000","description":"Apprentice finalist Kathryn Burn is selling her u00a339 jaguar-print pyjamas for almost double the price of other online retailers selling near identical nightwear.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/03/24/2341142958286717581/480x270_MP4_2341142958286717581.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web
