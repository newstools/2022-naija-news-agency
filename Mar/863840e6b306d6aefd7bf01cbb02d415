 Everton’s 1-0 loss to league-leaders Manchester City at the weekend was overshadowed by an oversight from VAR. The referee was not sent to view what looked a clear handball by City’s Rodri. The incident in question saw the ball appear to strike the Spaniard on the arm, inside the box. However, VAR decided the referee did not need to view the incident on the pitch-side monitor. An Everton penalty could have changed the outlook of the game. However, Lampard’s side were resigned to defeat, as Phil Foden’s 82nd minute strike was the only goal. Naturally, Lampard was enraged by the decision in the knowledge his team could have earned a point. The manager blasted the decision, calling it “incompetence at best.” “I have a three-year-old daughter at home who could tell you that was a penalty,” he added. Everton were said to have submitted a formal complaint on the matter, following the game. The Merseyside outfit have since received an apology from the Professional Game Match Officials Board Head of Referees, Riley, per The Mirror. Riley is reported to have phoned both Lampard and Everton chairman Bill Kenwright to personally apologise. It seems Riley is of the belief the wrong decision was made by the match officials. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2060455" src="https://i0.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Aster Vranckx, Yannick Gerhardt, Wolfsburg, February 2022." width="1080" height="567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/28113526/aster.vranckx.yannick.gerhardt.wolfsburg.february.2022-1-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> In other news, Everton are reportedly interested in Wolfsburg midfielder Aster Vranckx.
