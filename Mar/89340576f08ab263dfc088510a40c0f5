In a candid chat with Variety, the reality star passionately urged women to ‘get your f**king ass up and work’. She said: ‘It seems like nobody wants to work these days.’ Naturally, her words of wisdom didn’t go down well, with fans branding her outlook as ‘tone-deaf and offensive’. Addressing the backlash on Good Morning America, Kim stressed that her comments were ‘taken out of context,’ and apologised for the way it was received. During her final segment on Tuesday’s show, the 62-year-old presenter watched the clip of the media personality stressing that her words weren’t a ‘blanket statement towards women.’ Which resulted in an unsympathetic Lorraine hitting back with: ‘Whatever.’ Short and sweet. The mum-of-four’s wild rise to worldwide fame was captured for the cameras as part of her reality program, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which came to an end last year.
