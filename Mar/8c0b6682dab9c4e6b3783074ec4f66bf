One year on and Piers Morgan has no regrets about storming out of the Good Morning Britain studios. The presenter infamously got up from behind his desk and walked straight out of the ITV programme live on air after clashing with weatherman Alex Beresford over Meghan Markle and her interview with Oprah Winfrey. Later that day, it was confirmed that Morgan had decided to quit Good Morning Britain for good. Morgan posted a gif of him going off in a huff as he addressed the anniversary of his abrupt departure on social media. ‘A year ago today, I went for a little stroll… and in the words of Edith Piaf, je ne regrette rien! #LongWalkToFreedomOfSpeech,’ he tweeted. Viewers will remember that Morgan’s exit was sparked when Beresford defended Harry and Meghan during a heated discussion on the programme.

Has she said anything about you since she cut you off? I don’t think she has but yet you continue to trash her.’ Morgan also readdressed his comments that he’d made about the Duchess Of Sussex’s mental health after he had previously said he didn’t ‘believe a word she says’ in regards to her past struggle with suicide. Ofcom reported that it had received more than 41,000 complaints about his remarks and was investigating, however later cleared Morgan. ‘When we talked about this yesterday, I said as an all-encompassing thing I don’t believe what Meghan Markle is saying generally in this interview, and I still have serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what she said,’ Morgan said at the time as he clarified what he meant.
