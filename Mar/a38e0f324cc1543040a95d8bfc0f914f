Naija News reports that the CEO while speaking on Tuesday in Lagos, said the company’s commitment to environmental disclosure and sustainability yielded desired results last year with the Carbon Disclosure Project which increased the company’s rating. As revealed in the company’s financial report for the full year that ended December 31, 2021, it recorded revenue worth N1.38 trillion made up of N993.34 billion from Nigeria while revenue from across African plants was N397.32 billion, against the N1.03 trillion in 2020, translating to 33.78 per cent increase. Group sales volume for Dangote Cement for the full year, stood at 29.3Mt, with operation in Nigeria accounting for 18.61Mt and 10.86Mt in other countries. The company recorded a gross profit of N538.37 billion and an after-tax profit of N364.44 billion, a development that prompted the proposed dividend of N20.00 per share.

The CDP is an international non-profit organisation based in the UK, that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions, to manage their environmental impact.
