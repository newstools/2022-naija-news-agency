 Manchester United will be in desperate need of a striker in the summer. Edinson Cavani, 35, is set to leave at the end of the season, while Cristiano Ronaldo’s future at Old Trafford is also in doubt. The 37-year-old’s influence is under scrutiny. The Manchester Evening News claim Ralf Rangnick has “major reservations” about the prospect of Ronaldo spearheading United’s attack next season. The club are also without the suspended Mason Greenwood and Rangnick has made it clear a striker or strikers are required. Asked about the need for a new frontman in the next transfer window, Rangnick said last month: “This is obvious. “Edinson’s contract is running out in the summer and the club needs the best possible centre-forward. I think everyone is aware of that.” One of the player’s linked has been Benfica attacker Darwin Nunez. According to The Sun, who cited reports in Portugal, Man Utd scouts were ‘in attendance’ during Benfica’s league game against Tondela last month. Now Record, via Sport Witness, report that United are firmly in the race to sign the 25-goal striker. It’s clear that Benfica are hoping for a bidding war for the 22-year-old. Benfica set a €60m price tag for the Uruguay international in January. But they resisted offers for him, despite getting offers close to that figure. Now they are preparing to set a new price tag on the player with the last figure believed to be “modest”. Just what the price tag will be set at remains to be seen, but Nunez is under contract until 2025.  He is also in the form of his life and has a €150m release clause written into his contract. While Benfica know they will struggle to get close to his buyout clause, we can expect them to set a figure considerably more than the €60m January price tag. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2051518" src="https://i0.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lucas Torreira, Weston McKennie and Adrien Rabiot" width="1080" height="567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/02/08084604/Lucas-Torreira-Weston-McKennie-and-Adrien-Rabiot-during-a-match-between-Juventus-and-Fiorentina-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Chelsea are open to the prospect of signing Adrien Rabiot from Juventus in the summer as part of a swap deal for Jorginho.
