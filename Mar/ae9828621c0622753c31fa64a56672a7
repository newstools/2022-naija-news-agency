It’s been nearly a week since season two of Bridgerton dropped on Netflix, and attentive fans have decoded a secret meaning in Kate Sharma and Lord Anthony’s love scene. *Spoilers ahead for Bridgerton season two episode eight* The regency drama made its long-awaited debut on March 25 and the classic enemies to lovers trope between Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate (Simone Ashley) has left viewers relieving their journey again and again. Scandal reigned supreme in the second instalment as Anthony was on a quest to find a suitable Viscountess, and after a string of unsuccessful dates, he set his sights on Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), Kate’s younger sister. However, the sizzling chemistry between Kate and Anthony couldn’t be ignored and that became apparent to viewers in episode three titled A Bee in Your Bonnet. During an intense debate, Kate was stung by a bee, and the Viscount appeared terrified that she might die, as he witnessed his father, Edmund Bridgerton (Rupert Evans) die from a bee sting several years previously. In the last episode titled The Viscount Who Loved Me, the final few minutes show a happily married Kate and Anthony lying in bed naked, with Anthony planting kisses on her neck and chest – which marked the same spot where she was stung by the bee. Naturally, fans had to address the beautiful moment representing Anthony’s desire to protect Kate following his father’s death on Twitter. ‘Omg I just remembered it’s where she got stung I was so caught up in the moment lmfaooo,’ one viewer wrote. ‘I’ve never gotten goosebumps like this before,’ echoed another. In the books by Julia Quinn, Edmund dies at the age of 38 after being stung by a bee while Violet is pregnant with their eighth child, Hyacinth. <img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-03-30-at-10.41.37-2132.png?resize=1080%2C286&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-16371264" width="1080" height="286" alt="Twitter" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-03-30-at-10.41.27-9172.png?resize=1080%2C300&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-16371268" width="1080" height="300" alt="Twitter" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-03-30-at-10.55.24-df78.png?resize=1080%2C352&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-16371279" width="1080" height="352" alt="Twitter" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-03-30-at-10.56.19-efbc.png?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-16371286" width="1080" height="410" alt="Twitter" data-recalc-dims="1"> From the panic attack Anthony had, and the whole range of emotions he felt after a bee sting, it’s no wonder he stayed away when Kate fell from her horse.
