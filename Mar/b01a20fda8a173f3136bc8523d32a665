Kuleba described the conditions by President Vladimir Putin’s government as ‘unacceptable’. “There is little space for diplomacy in Putin’s mind,” the Minister was quoted as saying in a conversation with US policy forum. “We have to keep the channel of diplomacy open, while being aware of the attempts of Russia to publicly manipulate this track,” Kuleba added. He explained further that negotiations are ongoing but Russia still puts forward demands which are unacceptable. “We will not make any compromises on the existential issues for Ukraine,” he said. Naija News understands that Kuleba’s statement is coming after a French official had told CNN that Putin seemed still to be “determined to achieve his objectives in Ukraine”. The official’s comment is coming after the French President, Emmanuel Macron had a phone conversation with the Russian leader. In his submission, Kuleba said the removal of President Putin as Russian president would be enough to stop the ongoing rift between the two European countries. He was grim about the consequences of the war, saying it will make Ukrainians hate Russia. “We will not forgive them for generations,” he said.
