West Ham boss David Moyes has been dealt a major blow for the side’s Premier League clash with Liverpool, with vice-captain Declan Rice unavailable due to an illness. Rice has enjoyed an outstanding campaign after playing a key role for England at Euro 2020 and is fast establishing himself as one of the finest midfielders in Premier League football with his performances. But the 23-year-old has been forced to sit it out for this evening’s highly-anticipated encounter between the Hammers – who sit fifth in the table – and second-placed Liverpool at Anfield. Croatia international Nikola Vlasic, a second-half substitute in the Irons’ last four matches, comes into the side in Rice’s absence and starts alongside Tomas Soucek on Merseyside. Liverpool, meanwhile, have made eight changes from the team that beat Norwich in the FA Cup in midweek, with Alisson, Ibrahima Konate and Jordan Henderson the only players to continue their run in Jurgen Klopp’s starting XI. ‘Absolutely gutted to be missing today’s game through illness. Come on boys!’ Rice posted on Twitter ahead of kick-off. Absolutely gutted to be missing todayâs game through illness.
