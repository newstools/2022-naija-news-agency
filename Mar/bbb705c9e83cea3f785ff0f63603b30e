Former Strictly Come Dancing pro Brendan Cole swapped the salsa for skates this year as he took part in Dancing on Ice. The 45-year-old has made it all the way to the final of this year’s competition after wowing judges throughout the series, even landing the first 10s of the series. Whether he skates his way to potential DOI glory or not remains to be seen, but what is known is that Brendan has amassed quite a tidy fortune during his career as a dancer, Strictly pro and TV personality. Ahead of the finale, let’s take a look at Brendan Cole’s career and who he’s married to. Cole started dancing at the age of six and went on to become a professional dancer after leaving school at the age of 17. He was one of the original professionals who joined Strictly Come Dancing when it launched in 2004 and stayed with the show for over 10 years. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T28S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/26/13/55833673-0-image-a-81_1648302189711.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-03-26T13:41:33+0000","description":"Dancing on Ice star Brendan Cole shares sweet video dancing with daughter.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/03/26/5126610547783060542/480x270_MP4_5126610547783060542.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

                            video During his time on Strictly, he has won one series – the first season in which he was partnered with Natasha Kaplinsky. As well as being a professional dancer on Strictly, Brendan is known for being a judge on the New Zealand reality show Dancing With The Stars. His career has earned him a reported net worth of an estimated £3million. He is married to model Zoe Hobbs. On her Instagram she describes herself as a ‘Wellness blogger. Holistic health, lifestyle, travel, interiors.’ Zoe also runs a well-being website Fashionably Balanced. After meeting in 2008, she and Brendan tied the knot two years later in a star-studded wedding with several Strictly stars in attendance, including the late Sir Bruce Forsyth and dancers Anton Du Beke and Karen Hardy. The pair share nine-year-old daughter Aurelia together. The couple also welcomed son, Dante, in March 2018. Cole was famously very private about his children, but he recently shared an Instagram video with daughter Aurelia. Explaining why he was now sharing more of his family life, he told his followers: ‘We have always tried not to post photos of our beautiful children’s faces to the world of social media, at least until we felt they were old enough to make their own decisions about being seen or not. ‘The time has come where my daughter wants to be involved and after spending the last few Sundays on the telebox supporting daddy, I figured it was ok as she is has now well and truly been seen.’ The Dancing on Ice final starts tonight, March 27, from 7pm on ITV MORE : Brendan Cole slams being portrayed as ‘fiercely competitive’ on Strictly Come Dancing: ‘They pushed that side on me’ MORE : Dancing on Ice judges slammed after Brendan Cole is ‘too harshly penalised’ for fall Follow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
