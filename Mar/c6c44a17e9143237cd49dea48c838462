BBC Three viewers were shocked to learn that a couple had been in the talking stage for five years without video chatting. Love In The Flesh made its grand debut on Wednesday, with Zara McDermott welcoming daters who have endured a long-distance online relationship without meeting in person. But carer Jess, 24, shocked Zara and the rest of the gang when she expressed that every time she tried to reach out to entrepreneur Kwame, 28, she always ended up with a ‘blank screen.’ As Kwame made his entrance, Jess couldn’t hold back her tears and the pair shared a touching yet totally overdue embrace. ‘Well we’ve heard her side, but why did you never FaceTime?’ asked fellow co-star Chibz, as the couple sat down with the others. ‘You see me, I’m not really a FaceTime guy, you know. You see me on Instagram innit,’ Kwame replied. The contestants weren’t the only ones shaken by the revelation, as fans quickly took to Twitter to address their confusion. One viewer wrote: ‘How can you date someone online for 5 years and not even FaceTime. That’s so mad.’ While another added: ‘Too much struggle love on this show. Talking stages are wayyyyy too long! Free yourselves from the shackles.’ Despite the obstacle they’ve already faced, Jess believed that Kwame ‘could be the one.’ Talking for 5 years ????
