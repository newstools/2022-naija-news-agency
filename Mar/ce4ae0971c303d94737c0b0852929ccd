 Xander, from New York, who claims he belongs to “Zelensky Batallion” of the Ukraine’s International Legion, shared his experiences on Wednesday, while spotted in Korczowa reception centre, Poland. He revealed that he was in Ukraine until couple of days ago, when he left after an air strike occurred in Lviv region. After he reportedly suffered minor injuries, he decided to move to Poland to offer emotional and moral support to fighters who go or return from Ukraine. On February 27, president Vladimir Zelensky announced the creation of an International Legion for foreigners willing to fight side by side with Ukrainian forces, and introduced a visa-free regime for those who want to take part in military actions. Reportedly, around 16,000 foreigners volunteered to join Ukrainian International Legion. Listen to Xander in the video below.
