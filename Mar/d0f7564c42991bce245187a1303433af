The President disclosed this while speaking to State House Correspondents shortly before his trip to the UK for a medical check-up. Mr Buhari said Mr Osinbajo would be assisted by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and the Chief of Staff. As of the time of filing this report there was no indication the President sent a letter to the Senate indicating the transfer of power to the VP in his absence in the country, which is the constitutional thing to do. The President said his absence from the country would not affect the running of the government. He said: ”Well, I cannot claim to be doing the work alone. The government is fully represented – the Vice President is there, constitutionally when I am away he is in charge; and the Secretary to the government and the chief of staff. So, no problem.” Recall that the president had initially planned to embark on the trip from Nairobi, Kenya after attending the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) at 50 in that country. His spokesman, Femi Adesina, had on March 1, said from Kenya, the president would proceed to London for “routine medical checks that will last for a maximum of two weeks.” However, the president returned to Abuja on Friday around 1.p.m, fueling speculations. However, Malam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, told newsmen that the trip had been moved to Sunday.According to Adesina’s statement, Buhari is due to return to Abuja in two weeks.
