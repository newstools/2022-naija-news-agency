The number of first-time buyers in Britain has almost doubled in the past year according to new research. It’s optimisic news, but unfortunately it is not seemingly getting through to would-be homeowners — nearly two-thirds of whom still fear they will never make it onto the property ladder. New research from the Barclays Mortgages’ First Time Buyer Index, combined its own data with consumer research and polled more than 2,000 potential or existing first-time buyers giving a snapshot view of the first time buyer market post lockdown. The study found that FTBs had jumped 98% between 2020 and 2021, despite a hike in property prices. New homeowners paid an average of £281,900 last year, which although less than the 2020 average of £294,500, is up 13% from the average pre-pandemic price of £249,700 in 2019. Barclays found the average person started saving for a deposit at 24, taking eight years to save enough for a down payment on their first home, with the average age of a first-time buyer staying constant at 32. Most people (62%) said they relied on their own savings, but more than half (56%) said they wouldn’t have been able to buy their first home without family support or a financial contribution. Saving for a deposit was cited as the biggest obstacle to home ownership by 35%, with more than 70% saying they wished they’d started saving earlier. Purchase price: £281,900 Age at completion: 32 Deposit (solo): £61,100 Deposit (joint): £61,000 LTV: 81% Monthly payment: £845 Income (solo): £50,800 Income (joint): £70,600 But the survey also revealed confusion from potential homeowners about how to even start the process. More than 55% confessed they had no idea where to begin, while 39% didn’t know they had to factor in solicitor’s fees. Nearly half were unaware of stamp duty — or that in some cases they might be exempt. The average income of a solo first-time buyer has also jumped, rising from £45,900 in 2019 to £50,800 in 2021, while the average household income of those buying jointly grew from £63,800 in 2019 to £70,500 in 2021, down from a high of £72,200 in 2020. The size of deposits, however, has fallen significantly — with first time buyers stumping up an average of £61,100 last year, compared to £71,400 in 2020. The average monthly repayment was £845, considerably less than renting a room in a central London house or flat. Claire MacPhail, mortgage expert at Barclays, said the figures painted an optimistic picture of the first time buyer market in Britain since the pandemic. Housing demand is hotting up rather than slowing down according to leading mortgage technology and data provider Twenty7Tec, which has already recorded its three millionth mortgage search this year. Five years ago, the millionth search was marked on April 28, two millionth on August 14 and three millionth on November 20. In 2018 the numbers were reached in March, June and August respectively. ‘It’s encouraging to see that people have been able to get onto the property ladder in increasing numbers since the start of the pandemic,’ she says. ‘But it’s worrying to hear that many still believe they’ll never be able to afford their first property. ‘Our index points to the importance of first-time buyers being supported by family so it’s essential for lenders to innovate to provide new ways in which first-time buyers can get a head start. Barclays offers different mortgage options for first-time buyers, including one which allows family or friends to provide 10% of your property price as security, which they’ll then have returned to them with interest.’ The impact of the pandemic is also clear, as the study confirms that many buyers are now looking outside London to find the home they want.

In a post-lockdown world, more than half of all buyers say a garden is top of their wish list for their new home. The pandemic is clearly having a lasting impact on home buyers: a garden was top of the list for first-time buyers with 50% saying they wanted their own outside space. The enduring popularity of new-builds seems likely to stay with the first-time buyer market. As people stretch their budgets, they are keen to find properties that need little or no work. Just 15% were prepared to take on a property that would need a new kitchen or bathroom, and only 2% were willing to consider significant renovation work. Do you have a story to share?
