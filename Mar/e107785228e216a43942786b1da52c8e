DeWitt, who became a VC after selling Drop, Inc. to Snapchat in 2016, shares five essential lessons for first-time founders wandering in the wilderness in search of an investor who’ll be “a true partner.” There’s an inherent power imbalance when asking a stranger for money, but “VCs should work to earn your trust,” writes DeWitt. “In many ways, it’s like finding the right spouse.” (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.
