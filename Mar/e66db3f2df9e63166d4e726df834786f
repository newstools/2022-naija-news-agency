                            video An English translator sounded like he’d broken down in tears as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky gave an impassioned speech to the EU. The embattled leader said: ‘I am glad that we have united all of you, the countries of the European Union, today, but I did not know that it would have such a high price – it’s a tragedy for me, for every Ukrainian, for our country.’ Zelensky is still in Kyiv on day six of Russia’s invasion, having refused an offer from the US to be evacuated from his country. He received a standing ovation from the European Parliament as he delivered his speech, which made a translator’s voice sound noticeably emotional.

We have a desire to see our children alive. I think it’s a fair one.’ He added: ‘With us, the EU will become stronger. Ukraine will be alone without you. We will prove our strength. ‘Prove that you are with us, prove that you are Europeans. Then life will win over death, and light will win over darkness.
