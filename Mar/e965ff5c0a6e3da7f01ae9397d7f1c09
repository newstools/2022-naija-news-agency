Elaborating on the rationale behind introduction of the new size, Mr. Akintayo Akinseloyin, the Brand Manager said, “in our customer research, we found that there was a huge gap between 75ml and 500ml SKUs. As most of the consumers buy and use between two to three of 75ml sachets on a single occasion, which is where the newly introduced 200ml shall key in conveniently and perfectly serving for those consumers”.
It also enables the opportunity of serving multiple occasions using just a single pack. in other words, with the new 200 ml bigger pack, consumer can now disinfect, whiten, and clean surfaces at the convenience of one pack.
This also comes in handy for those who may not want to go for the bottle options at the same time have volume of whitening and disinfection to do around the house. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-199446" src="https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=1200,601&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="1200" height="601" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?w=2404&amp;ssl=1 2404w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=700%2C351&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=1536%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1026&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=672%2C337&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=1038%2C520&amp;ssl=1 1038w, https://i0.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/564D9316-306B-4A8D-A771-3E5F82008E75.jpeg?resize=480%2C240&amp;ssl=1 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> “It is our constant endeavor to offer our customers a hassle free and delightful hygiene practice experience.
