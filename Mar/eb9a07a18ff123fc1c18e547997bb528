The incident has tr#ggered reactions since Monday, as Nigerians lament the level of insecurity ravaging the nation at the moment. The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, who spoke when he visited the victims who are being treated at the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital in Kaduna on Wednesday, revealed that the army had not charged the patients a dime.

Amaechi asked Nigerians to liaise with the hospital to contribute money as some of the patients who have b#llets in their body may need surgery. He said, “They said they have only seven (patients) left and the rest have been discharged. The ministry, and I think the federal government, are grateful to the Nigerian Army for providing such services. But one thing I have said to the Nigerian people is to liaise with the hospital management and see how much money they can contribute for the treatment of the patients.” Receive top breaking news, events, ideas, and more!
