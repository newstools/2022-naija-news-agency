Actor Sean Penn was spotted getting pulled over by a sheriff while driving through Malibu this week. The Oscar winner, 61, was cruising in his customised motor, which is fitted with a police-style bull-bar and flashing light strips. Penn, who recently returned from filming a documentary in Ukraine, was stopped by police on the Pacific Coast Highway. It is not known whether he was handed a ticket. Photos show the film star wearing his mask while talking to the sheriff at the roadside. He sat in his charcoal coloured motor that had a device installed on the front to protect its front from collisions, resembling what is used on cop cars. Penn has not long been back in America after he began shooting a VICE doc in Ukraine through the first days of Russia’s invasion, which has seen more than 1.5million refugees fleeing homes so far. The Fast Times At Ridgemont High star took to Twitter to voice his solidarity with the people of Ukraine, calling the war ‘a most horrible mistake’ by the Russian leader. He also said he had to ditch a car during filming before fleeing. Penn and another colleague walked to the Polish border after President Putin invaded. The director wrote: ‘Myself & two colleagues walked miles to the Polish border after abandoning our car on the side of the road. Almost all the cars in this photo carry women & children only, most without any sign of luggage, and a car their only possession of value.’ His tweet was accompanied by a photo of him walking along the road, wheeling his suitcase while a string of cars were abandoned for miles. Penn had earlier tweeted: ‘Already a brutal mistake of lives taken and hearts broken, and if he doesn’t relent, I believe Mr. Putin will have made a most horrible mistake for all of humankind. Already a brutal mistake of lives taken and hearts broken, and if he doesnât relent, I believe Mr. Putin will have made a most horrible mistake for all of humankind. President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people have risen as historic symbols of courage and principle.

If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost.’ The filmmaker began production for his documentary in November last year, focussing on the escalating tension in Ukraine. He was in the capital Kyiv when attacks were launched and sat at a government press briefing just hours into the invasion, representing VICE.
