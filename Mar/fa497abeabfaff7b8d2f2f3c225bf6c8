                            video Shocking new footage has emerged of how the people of Ukraine suffered after Russia bombed a theatre they were sheltering in. The Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre in Mariupol was struck on March 16, killing at least 300 people who were shielded from Russian airstrikes. Vladimir Putin’s military made the decision to shell the three-storey venue despite the Russian word for ‘children’ written in large letters outside. Now, newly released footage shows people covered in dust running down the stairs to escape. This part of the video was seemingly filmed in the area of the theatre which managed to remain standing – the main building and a ‘relatively modern’ bomb shelter inside. But other parts of the clip show how a different section of the venue was dramatically reduced to pieces. The remains of completely unrecognisable materials can be seen piled between two obliterated walls. Mariupol’s government announced the most recent death toll on Telegram today, after previously revealing that at least 130 people survived once they were pulled from the rubble. Many of the 1,300 people who were estimated to be sheltering in the theatre were believed to be women and children. Mariupol has seen horrific death and destruction in the last few weeks, as Russian soldiers clamp down to keep control of the southeastern port city. Emergency services have had to respond to so many disasters that civilians had to start rescuing those stuck in the theatre after it collapsed. Thousands have fled Mauripol with many left behind without much food, drinking water, internet connection or electricity. {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metro.co.uk","duration":"T1M34S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/24/16/55756963-0-image-a-67_1648138920488.jpg","uploadDate":"2022-03-24T16:19:53+0000","description":"Ukrainian officials say civilians trapped in Mariupol, which is normally home to about 400,000 people, face a desperate plight without access to food, water, power or heat.","contentUrl":"https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2022/03/24/4919643263144510709/480x270_MP4_4919643263144510709.mp4","height":270,"width":480}  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

                            video Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry has also claimed Russian troops have taken up to 6,000 Mauripol residents into camps in remote parts of Russia. The civilians are allegedly being kept to be used as hostages. The United Nations has announced it will investigate, having already confirmed 36 abductions. Moscow has also been accused of confiscating the identity documents from some 15,000 people. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, the country has suffered widespread damages and loss of life amid a major bombing campaign. Millions of people have fled the country, with thousands of British people opening up their homes to Ukrainian refugees. Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t shown any signs of calling off the attack anytime soon, with his spokesperson claiming that he is refusing to rule out using nuclear weapons.
